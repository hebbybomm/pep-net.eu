				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In modern democracies, people are to be empowered by means of information and communication technologies. Transparency and access to data, new ways of interacting with government and democratic institutions cause profound changes in society. Social media and the new forms of societal behaviour, including content generation, collaboration and sharing as well as network organisation change our understanding of politics and business. Governmental and private internet services have increased the citizens’ independence and flexibility. However, enthusiastic ideas and projects often failed to produce the expected results as technology is only the basis for new forms of organisation and interaction. CeDEM12 seeks to critically analyse present and future developments in e-democracy and open government. &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/cedem" target="_blank">http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/cedem</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3473" title="jedem1" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2010/09/jedem1.jpg" alt="Jedem journal www.jedem.org" width="250" height="217" /></p>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.jedem.org/issue/view/3">PEP-NET Special Issue of eJournal of eDemocracy (JeDEM),</a> which Francesco Molinari and Rolf Lührs guest edited, is now available at www.jedem.org. It addresses the topic &#8220;sustainable eParticipation&#8221;, asking what &#8216;sustainable&#8217; means in this context and turning to experts in the field for advice on ensuring European eParticipation projects overcome problems with low participation rates and impact.</strong></p>
<p>The Special Issue contains a total of nine papers, three of which are invited papers from prominent eParticipation actors. The remaining six are scientific research papers and case studies.</p>
<p>The authors are successful in shedding new light on eParticipation, with a wealth of hints and tips on how to make eParticipation sustainable. Here is a list of concrete prerequisites for sustainable eParticipation gathered from the various papers as part of the editorial:</p>
<p>&#8211;         A favourable policy and legislative framework (Chrissafis and Rohen, Hinsberg);</p>
<p>&#8211;         Official recognition from the public decision-makers (Badouard);</p>
<p>&#8211;         Efficient (Velikanov) and transparent (Johnston) procedures for the aggregation and visualisation of user preferences;</p>
<p>&#8211;         Trust building on the whole process (Rodrigues Filho);</p>
<p>&#8211;         A suitable ICT infrastructure (Hinsberg, Hermida) posing weak constraints on users&#8217; behaviour (Badouard) and making the most out of the inputs (Li);</p>
<p>&#8211;         A community of active (Hinsberg) and skilled (Maier-Rabler and Huber) citizens;</p>
<p>&#8211;         A participatory culture among the population (Li, Maier-Rabler and Huber).</p>
<p>Of course it is not possible to distil the whole journal into a single blog post &#8211; you will simply have to read the journal to benefit from the wealth of knowledge and experience that it reflects by visting <a href="http://www.jedem.org/">http://www.jedem.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The journal was ready in time for last week&#8217;s PEP-NET Summit, at which the issue of sustainability was also raised. Like the Summit, the JeDEM Special Issue benefited from PEP-NET&#8217;s unique network of eParticipation actors across Europe and will help to ensure that there is ongoing reflection on how eParticipation can make a positive, long-term contribution to our democratic culture. JeDEM is published twice per year since first being published in 2009. The Centre for E-Government at the Danube University in Krems,  Austria, manages the publication process which involves a team of 35 editors.</p>

Nevertheless, e-participation in SEE countries is still falling behind their e-government developments. An overview of current e-participation situation in SEE within government domain will be presented, highlighting key elements needed for strengthening e-democracy in the region. One of them will be focused on non-governmental organizations and civil society e-participation experience (e.g. on-line Citizen&#8217;s forum) needed for shaping inclusive and citizens oriented e-government policy.</p>

<p><strong>Before becoming a social-media consultant and founding Birmingham-based </strong><strong><a title="Podnosh website" href="http://www.podnosh.com/">Podnosh</a></strong><strong>, <a title="Nick Booth on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/podnosh">Nick Booth</a> was a BBC journalist and then ran a government quango. He advises public administrations on using social media, is involved in many projects that promote active citizenship, and is a major player on the UK&#8217;s eParticipation scene. Nick is regularly invited to speak at conferences on social media.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Hi Nick. Thanks for taking the time to be interviewed for PEP-NET. First question: what does eParticipation mean to you?</p>
<p><span id="more-2187"></span><strong>NB</strong>: Hello. Podnosh does two things: on the one hand, we help citizens use social media to become active in their local communities; on the other hand, we work with public administrations &#8212; for example the Audit Commission, Birmingham City Council, Be Birmingham, FutureBuilders, and neighbourhood managements &#8212; to make sure that they listen to these conversations and take part in them.</p>
<p>So for me, eParticipation is more about employees of public administrations and politicians participating in discussions that are happening &#8220;out there&#8221; than citizens participating in online consultations that public administrations set up. The internet is changing society and public administrations need to adapt, not the other way round.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: That&#8217;s a really interesting view of eParticipation. So what examples do you have of conversations that public administrations could have &#8220;eParticipated&#8221; in better?</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: One example with huge potential for public administrations and citizens to work together is a website that I run: it&#8217;s called &#8220;<a title="Help Me Investigate" href="http://helpmeinvestigate.com/">Help Me Investigate</a>&#8220;. Anybody can ask a question, which people work together to answer. Public administration officials can help a lot by providing information to help people get answers. That is real transparency, but it requires a shift in attitudes so that public administration officials feel able to answer the questions the public want answered, not just ask the public questions that they want answers to.</p>
<p>I live and work in Birmingham, which has plenty more examples where citizens have taken the time to create solutions to problems instead of moaning about their local government. When the City Council consulted on a plan to undertake a major redevelopment of the city centre, they uploaded a PDF document to their website and invited comments via email. Many people in Birmingham thought this was a bit old-fashioned, so they created a website called &#8220;<a title="Big City Plan Talk" href="http://bigcitytalk.org.uk/">Big City Talk</a>&#8220;: the group paraphrased the document in more understandable English, and posted each paragraph individually so that people could comment on &#8212; and discuss &#8212; specific parts of the document.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the &#8220;<a title="BCC DIY" href="http://bccdiy.com/">BCC DIY</a>&#8221; example: when Birmingham City Council unveiled its new website last year, it was felt to be overpriced at £2.8m and not up to scratch. So Stef Lewandowski organised a group of people to spend a day developing a website that would show what a local authority&#8217;s website should look like.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: <a title="eParticipation in Birmingham, UK" href="http://pep-net.eu/blog/2010/03/03/eparticipation-in-birmingham-uk/">I wrote about some examples on PEP-NET a while ago</a>. So how does your work help local authority officers take account of what&#8217;s going on &#8220;out there&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: One example is our work with Neighbourhood Managers. Podnosh works with them to develop blogging platforms that have built-in monitoring tools that sift through the masses of information on the internet and notify them of information about the local area. That&#8217;s not the end of the story &#8212; it&#8217;s important that neighbourhood managers use the blog and participate in the conversations that are happening online. We also offer &#8220;social media surgeries&#8221; in the neighbourhoods to help residents use the blogs. This is really important because unless citizens know why and how they should use these tools, they are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: The <a title="Social Media Surgeries, on Podnosh.com" href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2009/04/30/birmingham-social-media-surgery-no-6-may-13th-2009/">social media surgery</a> is a model that you developed isn&#8217;t it? Tell me a bit more about that.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: It&#8217;s really simple: a group of bloggers from Birmingham volunteered to help voluntary organisations and anybody interesting in starting a blog about their local area get started in using social media. We kept it as uncomplicated as possible: we booked a room with wifi, volunteers brought their laptops, and anybody who wanted to try out social media was invited to come along and learn from them on a one-to-one basis, for free. Now the same thing happens every month in Birmingham, and the model has been adopted in other parts of the city, in other cities and even countries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a website that will allow anybody to set up social media surgeries with some tools to help them, and also collect information about how successful they are and how they can improve the surgeries.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: It sounds like you&#8217;re really busy, so I&#8217;ll just ask you one last question! Where do you see the future of eParticipation?</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: It&#8217;s all about mobile phones. People often say that lack of internet access leads to digital exclusion, but so many people access the internet through mobile phones that this is an increasingly important channel.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Thanks for you time Nick. Keep us up-to-date with what you&#8217;re doing!</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: You&#8217;re welcome. Will do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executive summary of presentation from the 11th Bled Forum on Europe Foresight Conference &#8220;The Future of Information Society and Challenges for Good Governance&#8221;, organized by the Centre for eGovernance development from 10th to 12th March 2010 in Bled, Slovenia:</p>
<p><em>According to the latest UN E-Participation Index measurement, the majority of South East Europe countries (Albania, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Romania), improved their global standing regarding the quality and usefulness of information and services for the purpose of engaging its citizens in public policy making through the use of e-government programs. Nevertheless, e-participation in SEE region is still falling behind their e-government developments. An overview of current e-participation situation in SEE within government domain is presented, highlighting key elements needed for strengthening e-democracy in the region. One of them is focusing on non-governmental organizations and civil society e-participation experience (e.g. on-line Citizen&#8217;s forum) needed for shaping inclusive and citizens oriented e-government policy.</em></p>
<p>Presentation slides are available at the Institute for Electronic Participation web site <a href="http://www.inepa.si/images/stories/mapping_edemocracy_see_region_delakorda.pdf">http://www.inepa.si/images/stories/mapping_edemocracy_see_region_delakorda.pdf</a> (pdf, 1.49 mb).</p>
<p>As has become customary over the years the conference concluded with a draft declaration, which had been adopted by the participants of the conference.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Independent but not neutral&#8221; is the self definition of Pollitika.com. Launched in 2006 by Marko Rakar, known for his political notes on his blog about the political situation of this south european country of 4.5 million inhabitants, Pollitika.com has become an inevitable website about politics. Three thousand bloggers are enrolled and contribute to the website. About 2.000 new articles are published every year for 150.000 visitors per month.</p>
<p>Mark Rakar is a passionate man. During the visit of the French National Assembly, proposed to the participants of the last World eDemocracy Forum, he enjoyed every moment and every picture. Curious by nature, quoting the American strategist Joe Trippi and convinced that an electoral campaign is &#8220;too serious matter to be left to political parties&#8221;, it was not a surprise that he is one of Top 10 Who Are Changing the World of Internet and Politics. During the eDemocracy Awards workshop, last october, he explained how Pollitika.com strengthened democracy in Croatie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last few weeks there was a lot of noise about <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/">Google Wave</a> and its potential to transform everything from newspapers to novel writing. The Wave approach, which consists of both a tool and a underlying protocol, has be discussed as being the solution that will unite online communication and therefore revolutionize the web at the same time as it has been described as being complicated and not very useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I wrote an <a href="../blog/2009/07/23/google-wave-%E2%80%93-what-is-that-again/">overview about the tool and the Wave protocol</a> earlier on this blog and promised to take a look at its possible implications for eParticipation. Luckily <a href="http://twitter.com/planspark">Tim Bonnemann</a> started a discussion on how to use Google Wave for eParticipation using the tool itself as soon at it was available. If you have a Wave account you can be <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BO_zF-kjmB">view it here</a>. In this article I will try to give the major points which have been made in that discussion. All the ideas presented in this text have been developed collaboratively by the 59 people have signed into this Wave until now. Thanks to all the contributors and especially Tim for starting the Wave! </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1524"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From a usability standpoint two things have to be pointed out: Google Wave is technically still in a preview phase and is having errors and problems quite frequently at the time. Secondly the implementation of the Wave Protocol presented by Google is offering a lot of features in a rather crowded interface which needs to be learned and get used to by new users. However this might change over time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Besides these general problems several use cases for the tool have risen from the discussion. These points are however mainly ideas at the time and have to be tested in practice. </span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Small-group dialogues</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Facilitated      chat</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Team-based, game-like      deliberations</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“Wave as a debate host” (see      this </span><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_wave_use_cases_education.php" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB">blog post</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> on ReadWriteWeb)</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal">„Wavestorming“</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To support group process,      participant interaction (e.g. by detecting mood&#8230; could jump in if mood      deteriorates)</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Real-time translation (this      could be really useful in places like Europe. 27 EU countries and almost      as many different languages)</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Collaborative      editing/commenting of legislative texts</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rearranging discussions into      reports that policy-makers can understand.</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Collectively describing a      problem or an issue.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 18pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Alongside these ideas two concrete example of Google Wave in policy discussions have been posted: One on the <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BO_zF-kjmB">debate on Health Care reform</a> in the United States and one on a <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:search,restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252B0u1MgqZkB.1">discussion on a legislative text</a>. Both examples are interesting but illustrate the usability problems mentioned above. The discussions are hard to follow and get very “noisy” even with a rather small number of participants. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Several participants in the Wave on eParticipation brought up the issue of intellectual property. Right now Google hosts all the content on Wave and even though the company states that <a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/legal_notices.html">they do not claim any ownership</a> this situation might be problematic when the tool is used for public participation in political processes. In the long run however any entity (governments, NGOs, etc.) can host their own instances of Wave independent from Google, which might be more comfortable for the participants and the hosts of the discussion. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At this point Wave is an invite only service. This fact of course is a showstopper for public participation processes but will change in the next few months. I have a few invites left. So if you need one just post the email address you need it to in a comment or <a href="../contact/">contact me</a> via email. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In summary Google Wave is still in a very early stage and is ridden with problems and limitations. It does not seem to be ready for wide use by non-technical minded people and therefore for public participation processes. On the other hand it could be very useful in supporting these processes. Moderators could use it to coordinate and to produce summaries of discussions. Or teams of translators could work in Wave in a multi-lingual setting. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is unclear how Wave will develop over the next few months and how the adaption will be when it is opened up to all users and independent instances of the Wave protocol show up on the net. Therefore the points made here can only be seen as hints to what Wave might mean for eParticipation.</span></p>
