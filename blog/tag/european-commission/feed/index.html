				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The e-(R)evolution Will Not Be Funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><em>“The  e-(R)evolution will not be </em><em>funded. </em><em>﻿An interdisciplinary and critical analysis of the developments and troubles of EU-funded eParticipation</em>”</strong></a> is the title of a paper that our <a title="Asociación Ciudades Kyosei" href="http://www.ckyosei.org" target="_blank">association</a> recently wrote as part of our research and knowledge dissemination efforts. The article is meant to be properly published soon, but  some bureaucratic issues have delayed its release more than we can  wait.</p>
<p><strong><em>Because this paper needs to be read and, more important, discussed while its analyses are still current.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank"><img class=" alignright" style="border: 1px solid black;margin: 3px" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/eRevolution.mini_.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="244" /></a>Thus, we have decided to make it provisionally available through PeP-NET. To start such a conversation, what better place than <a title="PeP-NET - about" href="http://pep-net.eu/about/">PeP-NET, the Pan European eParticipation network</a>? <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
We have spent many hundreds of hours researching and  writing the paper, as we struggled to make sense of the developments and  &#8220;under-developments&#8221; of eParticipation in the last ten years.<br />
Our  appraisal is based on an extensive and interdisciplinary analysis  of distinct relevant sources, which included the most recent reports,  articles and literature reviews dealing with eParticipation research,  practice and theory, as well as projects’ deliverables and evaluations,  related databases, and our direct examination of eParticipation systems.<br />
We had to resort to a very varied bunch of disciplines <em>(from history and medicine to Mayan performing arts; seriously!! <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> )</em> to be able to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the field’s challenges&#8230; and to make a compelling exposition of them.</p>
<p>The paper ended up being <strong>“quite controversial”</strong>, as  our assessment of <em>eParticipation </em>came to suggest that some of the <em>problems  that have hampered its progress have a systemic, overarching character</em>:  that kind of <a title="Elephant in the room (idiom)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room" target="_blank"><em>‘elephant in the living room’</em></a>-issues  whose very existence tends to be denied because of their complexity or  the embarrassment they cause and, as a result, cannot normally be acknowledged or  discussed, let alone get properly sorted out.</p>
<p>Examples of the <strong>&#8220;embarrassing questions&#8221;</strong> the paper poses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can it be that after 10 years&#8230; all relevant ‘agendas’ of eParticipation research are still reported as underdeveloped?</li>
<li>And  how can it be that even the most basic questions <em>–for example: the  relation of Participation and eParticipation, or the understanding of  the dual nature of eParticipaton as something that can be driven by  authorities or by citizens themselves– </em>remain unsolved?</li>
<li>More  than 187 millions of Euros were invested in the last ten years to  promote experimentation in the field, so&#8230; <em>where are the results?</em> Where  are the breakthroughs and the research milestones? Can we feel  satisfied with just some “vague confirmations” of ideas that 10 years  ago could already have been easily guessed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the paper, <em>we have done our best </em>to constructively diagnose  eParticipation and to propose some treatments for the field’s maladies.  But our perspective and understanding are necessarily limited: <strong><em>the real  “treatment” for those problems would require a reflection process that involves  the whole eParticipation community.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/spa_revolution.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 3px 6px;border: 1px solid black" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/spa_revolution-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="139" /></a>We see this paper as an <strong>urgent “call for self-reflection”</strong> and consider it a <em> <strong>“MUST READ”</strong> for anyone involved in European eParticipation</em>: from the officials working at EC’s <a title="Directorate for Information Society - eGovernment." href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/index_en.htm" target="_blank"><em>Directorate for Information society and Media</em></a>, to the researchers, practitioners, NGOs, public workers, citizen associations&#8230; and even any interested European citizen.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, w</strong><strong>e would like to encourage all our PeP-NET friends and in general all people with interest in eParticipation&#8230; to have a look at the <a title="The e-(R)evolution will not be funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> during this nice summer weekend. <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
Anyone who feels “touched” by any of the paper’s claims and  argumentations&#8230; should speak up and comment to this post. </strong>It doesn’t  matter if it is to support, extend or complement our asseverations, or  to oppose, challenge or further qualify them&#8230; <strong>please, share your  views.</strong><br />
PeP-NET was meant to be a HUB for the conversations around eParticipation. So&#8230; let&#8217;s discuss. <strong>It is important that the issues we showed –be them real or imagined–  are talked about, and possibly acted upon.</strong></p>
<p>The environment where we operate is moving. <a title="Spanish revolution" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPTiJi4CUk" target="_blank">Moving faster and faster</a>. And in the context of the <a title="Europe 2020" href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;Europe 2020 Strategy&#8217;</a> and its flagship initiative <strong><a title="Innovation Union" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm" target="_blank">&#8220;Innovation Union&#8221;</a></strong>, which aims to renew EU&#8217;s &#8220;Research and Innovation Funding Programmes&#8221;, the most important question we need to answer is: <strong><em>“What do we do now??”</em></strong><br />
For sure, we could keep pretending that there is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000"><em>NO</em></span></strong> elephant in the living room. Stay in our &#8220;academic&#8221; Ivory Tower, and just continue doing as we did so far&#8230; while we wait for the <em>“barbarians of eParticipation”</em> to arrive, change the democratic landscape by really integrating ICT in  governance&#8230; and make fools of all us. PeP-NET subscribers included.  <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>But in our <a title="Asociación Ciudades Kyosei" href="http://www.ckyosei.org" target="_blank"><strong>association </strong></a>we want to believe that we, the European eParticipation Community, could do much better than that.</p>
<p>So&#8230; no more to say!! <strong>Thank you very much for your attention. We hope  some of you enjoy reading of our <a title="The e-(R)evolution will not be funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> and some exchange of ideas  can happen afterwards.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Far from winding down for Christmas, this week sees a lot of European eParticipation-related activity in Brussels and Strasbourg. The launch of the eGovernment Action Plan, the presentation of the Citadel Statement and the expected adoption of regulations on the European Citizens&#8217; Initiative by the European Parliament in Strasbourg mean that this is a busy week for European eParticipation enthusiasts.</strong></p>
<p>At the &#8220;<a title="Lift Off Towards Open Government" href="http://www.opengov2010.be/">Lift Off Towards Open Government</a>&#8221; in Brussels, Digital Agenda Commissioner and Vice President of the European Commission Neelie Kroes will launch the eGovernment Action Plan 2015. Following the launch, the conference will hear from eParticipation and eGovernment actors from the Commission and across Europe.</p>
<p>At the pre-conference yesterday, Geert Bourgeois (Vice Minister-President of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Administrative Affairs, Local and Provincial Government) launched the Citadel Statement, a pan-European declaration that aims to identify what local government really needs to deliver on the vision set forth in last year’s Malmo Ministerial Declaration on e-government. The Citadel Statement, the result of an open discussion in which anyone could makes suggestions and vote on other people&#8217;s suggestions, is broken down into the following headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Architecture, Shared Services and Standards</li>
<li>Open Data, Transparency and Personal Rights</li>
<li>Citizen Participation and Involvement</li>
<li>Privacy and Identification of Individuals</li>
<li>Rural inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pep-net.eu/files/2010/12/jhe-2010Dec15-101239.pdf">Click here for a PDF version of the full press release</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the European Parliament will vote on regulations that specify in more detail arrangements regarding the European Citizens&#8217; Initiative. The Lisbon Treaty made provision for one million citizens to force the Commission to consider initiating legislation in any area within its remit. A recent petition online called on the Parliament to adopt &#8220;effective regulations for the European Citizens&#8217; Initiative&#8221;; see <a title="Avaaz petition on ECI" href="http://pep-net.eu/blog/2010/11/26/avaaz-launches-european-citizens-initiative-petition/">my previous post</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">Much focus has been on Web 2.0 technology as an enabler for wider dissemination, awareness raising and not least participation and transparency. It is therefore interesting to see that Web 2.0 technologies are being used in various ways for a range of purposes in this year’s 5th Ministerial eGovernment Conference, 18-20 November, in Malmö (Sweden) and 4<sup>th</sup> European eGovernment Awards. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Webcast of conference sessions</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The plenary sessions and three of the parallel sessions at the Ministerial eGovernment Conference will be webcast live and on demand this year from the conference website <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff">.</span> In addition the ceremony for the 4<sup>th</sup> European eGovernment Awards will most likely also be the subject of a webcast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The programme is available on <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/programme"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se/programme</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">In addition to RSS feed, Twitter feed is available onthe Ministerial eGovernment Conference website <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se</span></a>. Participants are actively encourage to Twitter about the Informal Ministerial Meeting on eGovernment and the 5th Ministerial eGovernment Conference to use the hashtag #egov2009.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Online vote for European eGovernment Awards Public Prize</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">Following success of the first online vote in relation to the European eGovernment Awards 2007 in Lisbon (Portugal) the European Commission and the European eGovernment Awards Consortium decided early onto continue practicing what they preach.  The objective has been to: increase the visibility and status of public sector ICT projects in Europe; encourage good practice exchange, and; to encourage active involvement and participating in the European eGovernment Awards by the epractice.eu and wider stakeholder communities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The online voting for the European eGovernment Awards Public Prize was therefore launched late this summer and closed on 11 November at 18:00 CET. Members of the epractice.eu community have been able to vote for their favorite cases from among the 52 European eGovernment Awards 2009 finalists.  The online vote is in addition to other ICT initiative by the awards consortium and the European Commission for a fully electronic submission process via <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/">www.epractice.eu</a> and the remote evaluation of the received submissions by the jury in the first phase of the evaluation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The voting is now closed but the 52 finalist cases remain published at ePractice.eu and are open to receive members’ comments.  The winner of the Public Prize will be announced at the awards ceremony on 19 November at 18:30 – and likely to the subject of a webcast.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am always loving  the opportunity, to give news of good, impressive, useful services, tools, that are coming from the citizens and their groups, empowered by technology and courage.</p>
<p>Most of us have heard about the <a href="http://ted.europa.eu/">Tenders Electronic Daily</a> service of the European Union, which is a compelx service dedicated to European public procurement.</p>
<p>The TedBot is an innovative approach, to visualize the tenders and their results on a google map. In this form, it is a great example of how to use knowledge and personal interest to create an advanced service.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it will catch the eye of the European Comission, and will extend the TED with TedBot, showing a some megabites of wise leadership towards citizen initiatives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Participation supported by electronic tools is not just limited to political topics – this has been stated in relation to eParticipation in many discussions. Keeping this in mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_lab">Living Lab</a> approach which aims at involving users and stakeholders into research and development processes by using innovative often time’s electronic ways of organising cooperation is a close cousin of eParticipation. Yesterday I visited the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/livinglabs/events/index_en.htm">Living Labs Information Day</a> held by the European Commission in Brussels. This event gave me an overview of the LL activity in Europe and the possibilities arising from this trend for player from the eParticipation field.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The projects presented at this event ranged from research in wearable computing involving test sites in the Aerospace, Construction and Automobile industry (<a href="http://www.wearitatwork.com/">wearIT@work</a>) to projects working on environmental friendly lighting in urban areas and different developers of ICT tools sets to making working in a Living Lab context easier. Almost all research and innovation field were present at the event and could make a convincing case that the LL approach is significantly helping them to produce innovation in their field. Besides the variety of participants the number of ca. 250 also spoke to the importance of this approach. In the <a href="http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/">European Network of Living Labs</a> alone more than 100 LL are involved. The EC also supports this community using different programmes but the representatives where clear that the EC´s job is to support the cross border aspects and not the local or regional development.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The complexity of LL project is very high as dozens and more stakeholders have to be involved in a multi-step development process. The deep experience of the eParticipation community to organise complex communication processes and to work out conflicts in these processes could be of great help to the many different Living Labs active in Europe. It therefore is useful to build contacts into the LL community and try to find possibilities to gain advantages from each other. On concrete step in this direction could be to look for potential partners for future project proposals to the European Commission in that community. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission supports eParticpation with lots of different instruments and we are grateful that PEP-NET is among the funded projects. One of the main objectives of our network is, as you may know, to connect the scattered fragments of the eParticipation community or even to help establishing something worth to be called a community.</p>
<p>This is very easy said but much harder done as I experienced the other day. I discovered that the eParticipation scene is more fragmented and relevant information are far more distributed than I expected. And I have to admit that I lost my way in the Commission&#8217;s eParticipation jungle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35188692@N00/2492400149/sizes/m/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="jungle" src="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jungle.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>What has happened? Well, my trip started last week reading Simone’s PEP-NET <a href="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/?p=253">post </a>about <a href="http://europa.eu/debateeurope/index_en.htm">Debate Europe</a>, a project which I stumbled upon a few times without paying to much attention to it. <span id="more-261"></span>Although it is a great idea to provide discussion forums in all of the languages of the EU member states, I could not easily find the political and programmatic framework in which this project has been started. Thanks to  Simone’s post I learned that “Debate Europe” is just &#8220;one part of the ambitious Plan D (D for Discussion, Debate and Democracy)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Via Twitter, I became almost at the same time aware of another project funded by the EC called <a href="http://www.european-citizens-consultations.eu">European Citizens Consultations</a> (ECC 2009). This project sounded really interesting to me. Just as “Debate Europe” it provides forums in different languages on different topics, and has additionally a proposal and voting tool. Furthermore, the project aims to achieve concrete results which will be fed into “27 European Citizens’ Consultations” (to be ) attended by a total of 1,500 randomly selected citizens reflecting their country’s demographic composition.” This project is definitely worth another blog post to appear soon.</p>
<p>However, looking for some background information at the website, I understood that “ECC 2009 is co-funded by the European Commission’s “Debate Europe” programme.</p>
<p>Now I got confused: Wasn’t “Debate Europe” the forum project introduced in Simone’s article and the name of the programme “Plan D”?. Seeking for clarification I followed the link on the ECC website promising to provide more information. Unfortunately the respective site does not exist.</p>
<p>No problem, I thought, I will figure that out by visiting some of the different EU ePartcipation sites I have bookmarked. I started with the EU eParicipation Initiative <a href="http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/egovernment_research/eparticipation/index_en.htm">website</a>, which is considered with the eParicipation preparatory action. The third call of this has only recently been closed so there should be actual information on the Commissions’ recent activities available. But, oops, the “address you used is incorrect or obsolete” I was told.</p>
<p>Ok, on with the journey, let&#8217;s try some of the other resources. Next I visited the <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/community/eParticipation">ePartcipation and eDemocracy community</a> at  ePractice.eu portal. No mention of ECC 2009. Maybe something at the <a href="http://www.european-eparticipation.eu">European eParticipation</a> portal? No. At <a href="http://www.demo-net.org">DEMO-net</a>? Nothing.</p>
<p>I went back to ePractice.eu and searched for “Debate Europe”. Finally I found a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/wallstrom/communicating/conference/dialogue/index_en.htm">website</a> about “2006 &#8211; 2007 Citizen&#8217;s Projects &#8211; concluding Conference”.  “The purpose of this event” I read “was to draw on the experience gained from the six &#8220;Plan D&#8221; pan-European citizen&#8217;s projects co-funded by the European commission in 2006-7”.<br />
One of these projects is the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/wallstrom/communicating/conference/dialogue/projects-conclusions/index_en.htm">European Citizen&#8217;s Consultations</a>; Debate Europe is not among them (although there is a link to the Debate Europe website). The project description is only concerned with past events, just as if the project has already been completed.</p>
<p>So what can we learn from this?</p>
<ol>
<li> There is definitely a need for a network like PEP-NET trying to provide comprehensive information on eParticipation in Europe.</li>
<li> As PEP-NET we have still a long way to go to be recognised as network that must be informed about all Pan European eParticipation projects.</li>
<li> We should actively try to make our network better known among the different Units of the European Commission and prospective eParticpation projects.</li>
<li> Projects like ECC 2009 should be encouraged by the Commission to send project related information to at least one of the EC funded eParticpation networks or portals.</li>
<li> Consistency of EC eParticpation related websites could be improved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other recommendations?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discussion – Dialogue – Debate. That´s the slogan of the official discussion forum by the European Commission, “<a href="http://europa.eu/debateeurope/index_de.htm">Debate Europe</a>”. The Commission aims at actively listening to the public and getting involved into dialogue with citizens to raise trust in the European policy and to increase voter participation in the upcoming European elections 2009. The forum “Debate Europe” should gauge public opinion about the EU and about three important pan-European topics: climate change and energy, Europe’s future, Intercultural Dialogue. Additionally there is a forum for more general discussion about the EU and its institutions. European citizens from all Member States are invited to join and to debate with other citizens and members of EU institutions. <span id="more-253"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/debate_europe.jpg'><img src="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/debate_europe.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="64" class="alignright size-full wp-image-254" /></a><br />
Forums are moderated. Each of the four topic-based forums is introduced by a short summary, accompanied by supporting links and videos as well as by a short poll. Furthermore there is a discussion section for every of the national languages of the 27 Member States. Once registered, the users can participate in all national forums – a possibility a lot of participants use to contribute to the English sub-forum, where they can most easily get into touch with users from other Member States. Some postings are translated into all languages by official EU-translators, predominantly more official news from the Commission rather than opinions stated by civilian participants.</p>
<p><a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/487&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">“Debate Europe” is just one part of the ambitious Plan D</a> (D for Discussion, Debate and Democracy, as is mirrored in the forums motto, ), a strategy for a more open and active communication about the political work on the European level, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/wallstrom/pdf/communication_planD_en.pdf">first implemented in 2005</a> and <a href="http://www.european-net.org/content/view/136/11/lang,en/">continued since 2008 </a>: There seems to be a communicational deficit between the EU institutions and its citizens, leading to a decline in trust and confidence in the political system of the EU: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb69/eb_69_first_en.pdf">While 52 percent of European citizens still give a positive response to being a member of the EU</a> that number is about 6 percent under the percentage from autumn 2007, where 58 percent supported a membership. </p>
<p>Facing these challenges, the European Commission set up means for open and active communication, with “Debate Europe” being the overall motto of the projects. The forum itself is quite plain and simple – the Commission uses a ready-made forum software for its purposes. This offers some advantages: It is easy and cheap to implement and rather easy to use, it is proved to run stable on a lot of servers, there are standard FAQs concerning the most common technical questions and some users will already know how to navigate. But evaluating the results and feeding them into the political process could be rather difficult, especially with a very high number of postings, due to the rather unstructured outline of the discussion. </p>
<p>Moderation guidelines, as posted in the English sub-forum, are quite basic: no hate-speech, no xenophobia, no harassment, no party-propaganda. The moderators keep in the background most of the time, whereas moderator activity differs a bit from one national sub-forum to another: In the Dutch forum the moderators posted initial questions, the moderators of the English forum also raised some questions and posted polls. </p>
<p>There are about 3.376 registered participants – including civilians, moderators, translators and Commissioners as well as spokespersons. Most active discussion topic is the debate about the future of Europe. It is also interesting to take a look at the participation level in the different national forums: The English sub-forum contains the most postings, almost 78.600 in total – this does not come as a surprise, considering that a lot of non-native speakers post their opinion there as well; in the Greek (over 5300 postings) , French (about 3500 postings), Italian (about 1700 postings), and Spanish forums (about 2500), participation and posting frequency are also quite high, while participation to the other national forums is considerably lower. The German forum ranges in the middle, with about 740 postings in total. </p>
<p>“Debate Europe” is one step into the direction of a pan-European dialogue between citizens and members of EU institutions. The figures and the discussions themselves show that there can be raised interest and awareness of European topics by open communication. Yet there still is the challenge to enable a pan-European dialogue regardless of language capabilities, which enables also participants who cannot speak and understand English to discuss with people from other Member States – a task which will require a lot of resources. Another challenge is to raise awareness of the online-forum in the first place: citizens of the different Member States should have the same chances to get to know their possibilities to engage in pan-European discussions. Cooperation with national parliaments and also with national mass media will be needed to reach this aim.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://consilium.europa.eu/">Council of ministers of the European Union</a> issued a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1827&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">press release on November 27<sup>th</sup></a> which states the adoption of a strategy to reinforce the fight against cyber crime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime">Computer crime</a> or cyber crime is a major problem of the networked world we live in. Spamming, Phishing and Identity theft are just a few of the potential crimes which can be committed using networked computers or other telecommunication devices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From this angle it seems both reasonable and positive that the European Organisations try to crack down on these kinds of crimes. But a <a href="http://www.golem.de/showhigh2.php?file=/0812/63873.html&amp;wort[]=minister" target="_blank">deeper look into the announcemen</a>t and especially the proposed tools raises doubts and concerns. The Council suggests “operational measures, such as cyber patrols, joint investigation teams and remote searches to become part of the fight against cybercrime in the next five years”. The strategy also includes plans to link the different investigation forces in the member states closer together to improve their efficiency. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span id="more-250"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To show what concerns are related to this advance by the Council a look closer at the remote search measure is helpful. This measure is aimed at <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7758127.stm">searching computers hard drives</a> over the internet. But a remote search is only useful if the person who is suspected of a crime is not informed about the action. If the suspect would be informed a simple seizure of the computer by police forces would also do the trick. It is unclear how the planned strategy would try to implement such a tool technically but there is a clear threat to the privacy and rights of citizens. How can the investigators be sure that there are no false positives and computers of innocent citizens are searched? Will there be a need for a judge to approve these searches? Will persons whom computers were searches ever be informed about that attack? Could the tools used by the investigators be compromised and also used by criminals?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Besides the rightful doubts about the legality and normative questions related there is another important point: Like with the measures already as part of the <a href="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/?p=117">Telecom Package</a>, which is series of amendments to existing European Law and contains language which can be seen as a advance to implement deep package inspection and a criminalisation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">Peer-to-Peer infrastructure</a> in Europe, the practicality of a tool like remote search has to be questioned. The rising <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/02/1632255&amp;from=rss">proliferation of personal routers</a> protecting users from unsolicited connections makes it very hard to do a remote search from a technical stand-point. And even if a tool could pierce the protection provided by a router (which according to <a href="https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">security experts is very difficult</a>) it can be assumed that cyber criminals are using tools to protect themselves from being found. For example free and open source encryption software like <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">Truecrypt</a>, which incorporate modern encryption algorithms like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>, can be used to secure files easily. Breaking an AES-256 encryption with a reasonably long password might take a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force_attack#Theoretical_limits">few thousands to millions</a> of years even using high-end computers. Maybe ordinary internet users do not use encryption but high-tech criminals surely will and maybe already do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Summary it can be asked whether this kind of activities which clearly pose a risk to freedom and privacy and which efficiency is at least very questionable are worth the target at hand. Cybercrime has to be fought there is no doubt about that but the suggested tools at methods do not seem to be actually useful to fight high-tech criminals. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">However, rather than attempting to provide recommendations at this early stage of the project, this first iteration pose a number of tentative questions. Questions which reflect some of the main lines of enquiry appropriate to the study and may help frame the final recommendations. The questions have arisen as a result of the work carried out to date and the current report may as a result also serve as a partial overview of the study as it currently stands. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The next wave of deliverables is foreseen for publication in October/Novermber 2008 and will include updates of all current findings. The second version of the deliverables will therefore reflect the further analysis carried out by the Consortium as well as take into account comments made by the project’s Peer Review Group and the European Commission.</span></span></span></p>
