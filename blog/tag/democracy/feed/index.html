				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The e-(R)evolution Will Not Be Funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><em>“The  e-(R)evolution will not be </em><em>funded. </em><em>﻿An interdisciplinary and critical analysis of the developments and troubles of EU-funded eParticipation</em>”</strong></a> is the title of a paper that our <a title="Asociación Ciudades Kyosei" href="http://www.ckyosei.org" target="_blank">association</a> recently wrote as part of our research and knowledge dissemination efforts. The article is meant to be properly published soon, but  some bureaucratic issues have delayed its release more than we can  wait.</p>
<p><strong><em>Because this paper needs to be read and, more important, discussed while its analyses are still current.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank"><img class=" alignright" style="border: 1px solid black;margin: 3px" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/eRevolution.mini_.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="244" /></a>Thus, we have decided to make it provisionally available through PeP-NET. To start such a conversation, what better place than <a title="PeP-NET - about" href="http://pep-net.eu/about/">PeP-NET, the Pan European eParticipation network</a>? <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
We have spent many hundreds of hours researching and  writing the paper, as we struggled to make sense of the developments and  &#8220;under-developments&#8221; of eParticipation in the last ten years.<br />
Our  appraisal is based on an extensive and interdisciplinary analysis  of distinct relevant sources, which included the most recent reports,  articles and literature reviews dealing with eParticipation research,  practice and theory, as well as projects’ deliverables and evaluations,  related databases, and our direct examination of eParticipation systems.<br />
We had to resort to a very varied bunch of disciplines <em>(from history and medicine to Mayan performing arts; seriously!! <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> )</em> to be able to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the field’s challenges&#8230; and to make a compelling exposition of them.</p>
<p>The paper ended up being <strong>“quite controversial”</strong>, as  our assessment of <em>eParticipation </em>came to suggest that some of the <em>problems  that have hampered its progress have a systemic, overarching character</em>:  that kind of <a title="Elephant in the room (idiom)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room" target="_blank"><em>‘elephant in the living room’</em></a>-issues  whose very existence tends to be denied because of their complexity or  the embarrassment they cause and, as a result, cannot normally be acknowledged or  discussed, let alone get properly sorted out.</p>
<p>Examples of the <strong>&#8220;embarrassing questions&#8221;</strong> the paper poses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can it be that after 10 years&#8230; all relevant ‘agendas’ of eParticipation research are still reported as underdeveloped?</li>
<li>And  how can it be that even the most basic questions <em>–for example: the  relation of Participation and eParticipation, or the understanding of  the dual nature of eParticipaton as something that can be driven by  authorities or by citizens themselves– </em>remain unsolved?</li>
<li>More  than 187 millions of Euros were invested in the last ten years to  promote experimentation in the field, so&#8230; <em>where are the results?</em> Where  are the breakthroughs and the research milestones? Can we feel  satisfied with just some “vague confirmations” of ideas that 10 years  ago could already have been easily guessed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the paper, <em>we have done our best </em>to constructively diagnose  eParticipation and to propose some treatments for the field’s maladies.  But our perspective and understanding are necessarily limited: <strong><em>the real  “treatment” for those problems would require a reflection process that involves  the whole eParticipation community.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/spa_revolution.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 3px 6px;border: 1px solid black" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2011/07/spa_revolution-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="139" /></a>We see this paper as an <strong>urgent “call for self-reflection”</strong> and consider it a <em> <strong>“MUST READ”</strong> for anyone involved in European eParticipation</em>: from the officials working at EC’s <a title="Directorate for Information Society - eGovernment." href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/index_en.htm" target="_blank"><em>Directorate for Information society and Media</em></a>, to the researchers, practitioners, NGOs, public workers, citizen associations&#8230; and even any interested European citizen.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, w</strong><strong>e would like to encourage all our PeP-NET friends and in general all people with interest in eParticipation&#8230; to have a look at the <a title="The e-(R)evolution will not be funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> during this nice summer weekend. <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
Anyone who feels “touched” by any of the paper’s claims and  argumentations&#8230; should speak up and comment to this post. </strong>It doesn’t  matter if it is to support, extend or complement our asseverations, or  to oppose, challenge or further qualify them&#8230; <strong>please, share your  views.</strong><br />
PeP-NET was meant to be a HUB for the conversations around eParticipation. So&#8230; let&#8217;s discuss. <strong>It is important that the issues we showed –be them real or imagined–  are talked about, and possibly acted upon.</strong></p>
<p>The environment where we operate is moving. <a title="Spanish revolution" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPTiJi4CUk" target="_blank">Moving faster and faster</a>. And in the context of the <a title="Europe 2020" href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;Europe 2020 Strategy&#8217;</a> and its flagship initiative <strong><a title="Innovation Union" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm" target="_blank">&#8220;Innovation Union&#8221;</a></strong>, which aims to renew EU&#8217;s &#8220;Research and Innovation Funding Programmes&#8221;, the most important question we need to answer is: <strong><em>“What do we do now??”</em></strong><br />
For sure, we could keep pretending that there is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000"><em>NO</em></span></strong> elephant in the living room. Stay in our &#8220;academic&#8221; Ivory Tower, and just continue doing as we did so far&#8230; while we wait for the <em>“barbarians of eParticipation”</em> to arrive, change the democratic landscape by really integrating ICT in  governance&#8230; and make fools of all us. PeP-NET subscribers included.  <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>But in our <a title="Asociación Ciudades Kyosei" href="http://www.ckyosei.org" target="_blank"><strong>association </strong></a>we want to believe that we, the European eParticipation Community, could do much better than that.</p>
<p>So&#8230; no more to say!! <strong>Thank you very much for your attention. We hope  some of you enjoy reading of our <a title="The e-(R)evolution will not be funded" href="http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-(R)evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> and some exchange of ideas  can happen afterwards.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are all discussing the potential of the internet for democracy everyday. But sometimes it is nice to here the arguments of other people on this issue. <a href="http://fora.tv/2010/05/18/Debate_The_Internet_and_Democracy" target="_blank">Fora.tv</a> has posted a very good debate on on the question &#8220;Does the internet threaten democracy?&#8221; with Jimmy Wales (founder of Wikipedia), Andrew Keen (author of &#8220;The Cult of the Amateur&#8221;), Farhad Manjoo (author of &#8220;True Enough&#8221;) and Micah L. Sifry (Editor of the &#8220;Personal Democracy Forum&#8221;). All four stay in their tracks more or less (Yes Andrew Keen is as provocative as always).  In the end it is more a discussion of media as a whole and less about the internet in particular. But it is very interesting none the less.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Today humanity is facing an enormous multi-crisis dilemma – creating an ever-growing complexity of interrelated local, regional and global problem-patterns. Political decision-makers have a hard job finding appropriate solutions and depend more and more on scientific advice [1]. Leading advisers Martin Lees (Secretary General of the <em>Club of Rome</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">) and Karl-Henrik Robèrt (Founder of the <em>Natural Step</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">) have recently pointed out (in a personal conversation), that this incapability to come up with appropriate solutions has got systemic roots. Our institutions are built to cope with single issues within limited regional scopes, thus they are not apt to deal with such multi-crises-dilemma. Therefore, the generation and collection of information, its conversion into institutional knowledge and its use in decision-making processes have been recognized as crucial tasks [2].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From this point of view, our current multi-crisis-dilemma can be understood as a general crisis of today´s democracies, basically caused by its over-complexity and the lack of appropriate knowledge management systems based on the <em>integration of collective knowledge</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is now widely accepted, that only multi-stakeholder-inclusion can support our institutions with the necessary knowledge to face our challenges at stake. This requires a more networked approach of governance and a knowledge management based on public spaces for policy deliberation [3], [4].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But although the resulting frustration in the European population is manifested in decreasing voter turnouts on the one hand, and the use of ICT for eCampaigning and proactive action planning increases on the other hand, most eParticipation projects show quite a low citizen participation [5]. To understand this paradox it would be important to have a closer look at the technical tools and socio-political concepts being used in today&#8217;s eParticipation. </span><span></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivation and image

Global challenges such as the climate change and the economical crisis do increasingly worry the society. However, satisfying solutions to these challenges are not in sight. More and more people are dissatisfied with the political decisions of the representatives they have elected. One reason for that is the fact that most citizens do not understand the backgrounds and complex correlations of political and economical decisions and feel excluded from the decision-making processes. As a result, citizens are disenchanted with politics and lack civic commitment. In addition, existing possibilities regarding the participation in society and politics are not powerful and influential enough. Particularly young people increasingly lose their belief in democracy and fall into resignation.

These are the reasons for founding echo: echo is a platform for sustainable change and active civic participation and creates a basis for a democracy which is independent from political parties and in which people may participate at a local, regional, and global level. Citizens, experts, politicians, and decision makers in economy and society may discuss their points of view, mobilize fellow campaigners, plan activities together, and put them into practise. echo’s cross-platform approach overcomes the limits of particular portals and initiatives and therefore increases the power of their influence. echo builds on existing legislative instruments and therefore enables civic commitment to convert into true political participation.

echo acts as a social business and is committed to the basic ethical values of democracy as well as to the values of environmentally and socially sustainable economic management. Within the scope of its ‘your profit’ business philosophy, surpluses which are generated in the course of financing echo’s economic viability flow back into projects and ventures of the society. In this way, echo is a sample of a new business culture. When used in companies, its innovative social software directly contributes to strengthening a social and sustainable management style and to democratising existing business and economical structures. echo becomes a multiplier for sustainable ventures and a catalyst of democratic economic activities.

An interdisciplinary team of young and experienced academics forms the background of echo. These people are trained in the technological as well as in the socio-cultural and the economical field. A growing network of organisations, experts, as well as renowned intercessors increasingly supports this core team.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: normal">As we now have been PEP-NET member for about two months, we now finally would like to introduce echo to the ones who may not knows us yet &#8211; better late than never <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>
<h2>Motivation and image</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <strong>powerlessness</strong> and <strong>political resignation</strong> among the population and weakens people&#8217;s faith in democracy. Calls for <strong>transparency</strong> and more <strong>participation</strong> are growing louder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">The current crises can thus be understood as a general <strong>crisis of democracy. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 13.3333px">New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop <strong>constructive solutions</strong> to effectively tackle our “glocal” challenges. This is why echo has been founded: As a platform for sustainable change and <strong>active citizen participation</strong> echo enables a new form of non-partisan participatory democracy on local, regional and global level. With echo the first web-application is being developed to enable <strong>collective intelligence </strong>through democratic discourse even with a virtually unlimited number of participants.</span></span></p>
<p>echo offers a quick overview of  interesting discussions, gives people an opportunity to voice their opinions in a deliberative discourse and to jointly find the right solutions. On echo, people can connect with allies, experts and decision makers and together turn their decision into reality.</p>
<p>echo consists of three clearly separated functional areas, which at the same time are tightly interwoven:</p>
<h2><strong>Discuss, Connect, Act!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Discuss </strong><span>is the core area, which contains most unique features and enables </span><strong>collective intelligence</strong><span> to emerge. The discussions taking place in the discussion area offer a differentiated</span><strong> overview</strong><span> of the different statements edited and supported by certain regions or societal groups.</span></p>
<p>Every statement is edited through a self organized democratic process (without the need of moderators or admins). Thanks to the new <strong>semantic cross-language search engine</strong>, users can find easily a comprehensive selection of relevant information. With only minimal effort thousands of users can contribute to the dynamic evolution of sound statements.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> offers users an easy possibility to organizes their contacts, add interesting experts and opinion leaders their personal network and to connect people with <strong>specific competences</strong> relevant to a certain subject. To enhance usability and foster a viral growth there will be interfaces connecting several external social networks like twitter and facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Act!</strong><span> motivates the participants of discussions to proactively launch actions and projects, to jointly turn their ideas and visions into reality, and thus, make change visible in every day life. To do so, echo offers a virtual work space equipped with the necessary tools and information to efficiently plan and accomplish different kinds of actions and projects and found eco-socially sustainable businesses. </span></p>
<p>As most actions and projects will need funding, echo is based on powerful business models. &#8220;Powerful“ does not merely mean working cost-covering. It also means helping users to provide their actions with the necessary funds. This <strong>enables people to accomplish their goals</strong> and lets their virtual engagement influence our real world in a positive way, which is the key to <strong>motivate ever more people </strong>to participate on echo. Thus, the comprehensive concept of echo has true potential to free people from their sense of powerlessness, offer them a way of <strong>successful self-determination</strong> and help them restore their <strong>faith in democracy</strong>.</p>
<h2>Create Synergies</h2>
<p>In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a <strong>distributed approach</strong> and makes its functionality available throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog. In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and creates <strong>true synergies</strong>, instead of hamstringing competition.</p>
<h4>Shared User- and Opinion Base</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333px">Through cooperation with echo, partner platforms connect their communities with each other. This way, their different user groups are joint together in a single cross-platform community. The users can now connect throughout all platforms, discuss and jointly launch actions and projects.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, echo addresses to users on a larger scale exceeding such groups from existing platforms through an extended network with further organizations. This in turn, multiplies the range and influence of each single partner platform. Projects and campaigns profit from the viral dissemination and its huge and highly motivated community.</p>
<p>Discussions on issues, which are relevant to the different partner platforms can be initiated on any other partner platform, thus, enriching discussions and making them more interesting and alive. This way a much <strong>broader opinion base</strong> is formed, as possibly could emerge on any single platform.  New impulses and issues flow back and forth, enriching discussions and <strong>rising the attractiveness of all partner platforms.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">This thematic diversity – covering different thematic fields and ranging broadly and deeply into society – rises virality enormously. The synergetic effects allow for a common development of content throughout different communities, which offers interesting information to virtually every Internet user. Thus, the influence of the proposals elaborated in this distributed system will boost its influence on society enormously.</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="Calibri;">Last week many popular </span><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/michael-jackson-s-death-pushes-internet-to-limits-611501"><span style="Calibri;">news sites</span></a><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;"> (CNN, BBC, techradar etc.) reporting the unexpected death of pop legend Michael Jackson caused a world-wide slow down of the Internet which caused many popular engagement channels such as Twitter to crash!<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;"><span style="Arial;">His death generated the most tweets per second on Twitter since Barack Obama was elected president.</span><span style="black;"> In fact many of my friends in remote locations at festivals such as Glastonbury (UK) learned of the shocking news through SMS and Twitter on their mobiles, Blackberry’s and iPhones as cyberspace began to go into frenzy. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">This event raised many fundamental issues about the capacity of the internet that is critical to participation and democracy, as well as highlighting the global difference in how countries trust official and unofficial sources of information<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">For example, the “Michael Jackson outage” on the net (caused by the West accessing many ‘official’ sources of trusted information) resulted in many users who were finding the tool critical for organising protest in Iran unable to access their usual sources of ‘unofficial’ information, thereby effectively delaying demonstrations.<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">Ironically, despite the mainly unsuccessful efforts of the Iranian regime to shut down participation in the form of protests by denying citizens access to technology, it was actually the West who temporarily (albeit unintentionally) succeeded in achieving this feat through its overuse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">A clash of hunger for knowledge from official sources vs. the need to organize knowledge against official sources does raise interesting contrasts and demonstrates how far new media has the ability to focus our thoughts and actions in a modern world. </span></span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="3pt 0cm;"><span style="EN;">According to the recently published <strong><em><span style="&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions “Towards an accessible information society”(1.12.2008)</span></em></strong><em><span style="&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> </span></em>eAccessibility and Web accessibility in particular have emerged as a high societal priority due to the growing importance of the Internet and the explosive growth in online information and interactive services, namely online banking, shopping, government and public services, and electronic communication with distant relatives and friends.</span><span style="Arial;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="3pt 0cm;"><span style="Arial;"><span style="x-small;"><span style="Arial;">ICT-enabled government, participation and democracy can contribute to the objectives of inclusion in a variety of ways: by providing new ICT-enabled channels for delivering government services and making these services more accessible for people with special needs (eServices eAccessibility); making the democratic p process and governmental decision making more transparent, consultative and participatory through online information provision in all relevant languages and formats, deliberative initiatives and empowerment of advocacy groups that serve at-risk groups (eEngagement), and, by harnessing the same tools in a targeted fashion to make inclusion policies and initiatives themselves more transparent, participatory and accountable and by stepping up the provision of content relevant to groups at risk of exclusion. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="3pt 0cm;"><span style="EN-US;"><span style="x-small;"><span style="Arial;">Participation within an inclusive governance model is possible only if political, economic, technological and social barriers are removed and access to these opportunities is equitably distributed. Easy access to (ICT) is a prerequisite for participation. Facilitating this access entails, inter alia, removing barriers, making ICT tools easier for everyone to use, and encouraging people to use them by raising awareness of their economic and social benefits.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="3pt 0cm;"><span style="Arial;"><span style="x-small;"><span style="Arial;">Progress in this area remains fragmented and slow, despite such targets and many actions involving public authorities, industry and civil society. Accessibility of public websites remains stuck at 5%. Only 10% of people aged over 64 are Internet users while the average in Europe is 47%. Without further intervention, the gap will only be halved in 2015 instead of 2010. The latest assessments conducted for the Commission show that accessibility of websites, communication terminals, TV sets and other ICT remains problematic, with lower-educated, economically inactive and elderly people at the greatest risk of being left behind.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="EN;">Dear Colleagues,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="EN;">Many of you may already know the European Journal of ePractice (EjeP), but do you know that the next </span><span style="DA;">special edition is devoted entirely to eParticipation! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="DA;">The 6th issue of the Journal provides a good chance to write articles based on our work and experiences and provide an excellent opportunity to public, disseminate and most importantly to exchange experiences and ideas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="EN;">Launched in November 2007 the Journal belongs to the <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/" target="_blank"><span style="#800080;">ePractice.eu</span></a> community and is sponsored by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank"><span style="#006ac9;">European Commission</span></a> as part of its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/egovernment" target="_blank"><span style="#006ac9;">good practice exchange activity</span></a> and is run by an independent Editorial Board. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="EN;">The aim of the Journal is to reinforce the visibility of articles as well as that of professionals while strengthen the overall <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/" target="_blank"><span style="#800080;">ePractice.eu</span></a> activity. The Journal promotes the diffusion and exchange of good practice in eGovernment, eHealth and eInclusion and is available to all potential readers free of charge. The Journal currently has an audience of 50,000 professionals in Europe and beyond, and build on a community of some 14,000 members. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="DA;">The deadline is 8 December, but I know that the editor for the eParticipation issue Jeremy Millard can be pursuaded to extent the deadline till the second half of December if asked nicely. Relevant links are provided below. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">To consult the Australian public, strengthen the participatory process and outcome Kevin Rudd (Australian Prime Minister) announced in February 2008 an Australia 2020 Summit to help shape a long term strategy for the nation’s future – a strategy requiring long-term commitment and responses beyond the usual electoral cycle. In this connection more then 1000 opinion makers and citizens were invited to give their opinion and provide their input to help shape a long term strategy for the Australia’s future. More then 3600 persons and interest organisations submitted in excess of 8800 suggestions for evaluation and discussion culminating in the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra 19-20 April this year.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The summit and consultation process focused on ten areas deemed critical for Australia’s future i.e.:</span></span></span><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The productivity agenda – education, skills, training, science and innovation </span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The future of the Australian economy </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Population, sustainability, climate change and water </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Future directions for rural industries and rural communities </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">A long-term national health strategy – including the challenges of preventative health, workforce planning and the ageing population </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Strengthening communities, supporting families and social inclusion </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Options for the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Towards a creative Australia: the future of the arts, film and design </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The future of Australian governance: renewed democracy, a more open government (including the role of the media), the structure of the Federation and the rights and responsibilities of citizens </span></span></span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;"><span style="EN-GB;">Australia</span><span style="EN-GB;">’s future security and prosperity in a rapidly changing region and world.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Envisaged as a broad consultation on the future direction of the country the Australia 2020 Summit did not embrace ICT to its full extent replying instead on more traditional forums such as the submission of written proposals, an invitation to primary and secondary schools to participate in a series of school summits leading to a youth summit in Canberra (12-13 April) and a number of local summits may be hosted by local Members of Parliament in their respective electorates in advance of the Australia 2020 Summit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Although the tools chosen the process was supported by a designated website (</span><a href="http://www.australia2020.gov.au/"><span style="Times New Roman;">www.australia2020.gov.au</span></a><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">) providing information on the initiative, its progress and outcomes (i.e. eInformation). More interesting in relation to eParticipation the website does have a number of more advanced features including:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Options for online submission of proposals, print out of the submission form (.RTF and .PDF) for each of the prioritised topics plus the relevant instructions</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Options for viewing submissions made</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Video clips from school and local summits</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Live streaming on demand and web casts from the 19-20 April summit in Windows Media and Adobe Flash Player with links to downloads of these plus QuickTime</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Videos from the school and in particular the youth summit</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Initial and final reports</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Lists of participants from both the youth and the final summit</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">List of people in the steering committee including short biographies</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Media hub including a news centre with full transcripts, on demand web casts, image gallery, details on media accreditation and official use of the logo </span></span></span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">All in all the Australia 2020 Summit website makes full use of ICT in terms of eInforming and ensures easy access to information and results in relation to the both the public and media. By making the initial submissions, recommendations, reports, lists of summit participants and members of the steering available the initiative also ensure a certain degree of transparency. Unfortunately there is neither contact details included for participants or members of the steering committee nor a blog available for each contact. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"></span><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Of the submissions made, 1064 are available online including from local summits around the country which in most cases contain multiple proposals and opinions. An added bonus adding to the user friendliness and transparency of the initiative is the fact that online available online can be filtered and are searchable. The filters include the sorting by chronologically (newest/oldest), the ten priority/topic areas, submission ID and name of person, organisation or pre-summit having provided the input, last but not least the submissions can be searched by key words. </span></span></span></p>
