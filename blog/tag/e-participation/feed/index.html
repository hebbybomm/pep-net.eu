/Please note: This post is not from Hans Hagedorn, but from Steffen Albrecht @ <a title="Zebralog Homepage" href="http://www.zebralog.com">Zebralog</a> &#8211; Hans&#8217; avatar is displayed because of a malfunction of PEP-NET&#8217;s profile function &#8211; we&#8217;ll try to fix this&#8230;/</p>
<p><strong>Get involved in the latest developments of  eParticipation tools!</strong></p>
<p>Policy analysts, decision makers as well as civil society stakeholders and other people interested in policy-making all have to cope with numerous arguments brought forward in policy debates. The EU-sponsored <a title="IMPACT project" href="http://www.policy-impact.eu" target="_blank">IMPACT project</a> develops open source online tools that help to make sense of the range of opinions about public policies expressed in policy consultations.</p>
<p>In a <a title="link to webinars" href="http://policy-argumentation.posterous.com/webinar-new-online-tools-to-support-argumenta" target="_blank">series of webinars</a>, four new prototype tools will be presented, followed by an evaluation of the tools in which participants can discuss further improvements and the potential impact of the tools on policy-making. Based on material from the EU’s consultation on the Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy, the participants will learn how to formalise and visualise arguments, how to estimate the effects of policy proposals with the help of policy modelling, and how opinions about arguments are assessed with the help of structured consultations.</p>
<p>We invite all PEP-NET members and readers of this blog to participate!<br />
Please register for one of the following dates on this website:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<address><strong>Guest article by neu&amp;kühn</strong></address>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.neuundkuehn.at/" target="_blank">neu&amp;kühn</a></span><span lang="EN-US">, companion and developer of online projects with public participation, presented their recently published analysis for the project group E-Democracy &amp; E-Participation on the 8<sup>th</sup> of April, 2010. In the context of a best practice analysis more than 30 international e-participation examples were reviewed and important factors for a successful collaboration highlighted. The analysis works as guide for administration, politics and institutions. Authors Kirsten Neubauer and Peter Kühnberger view social media as an opportunity for dialogue, building of trust and mobilization.</span></strong></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Best Practice</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">E-participation examples of various sizes were reviewed – from small town councils with about 2.500 citizens to megacities. The following e-participation projects represent a selection of the analyzed projects from the areas of environment, damage reports, budget and urban development. The home countries of these projects are mostly in the Anglo-American area and in Scandinavia, where local as well as national initiatives for participation can be found. The German speaking area is more likely to be focused on regional topics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span id="more-2363"></span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Urban development: Essen has to grow quieter</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This project introduced so called “noise places” in the city of Essen, Germany. These noise places were marked on a map and suggestions how to handle them were made by the users, which could be rated and commented on. 943 suggestions and 1,143 comments were made and served as a basis for concrete measures. In a second phase, these measures were prioritized and through a package of urgent measures (i.e. financial aid for noise protection windows) decided on. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Damage Reports: FixMyStreet</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">FixMyStreet enables reports of citizen concerns, damage, pollution and similar issues via internet or mobile phone and shows if and how these reports are handled. The described places are marked on a map. Another project in the area of damage reports for citizens is Maerker Brandenburg, active in Germany. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Financial planning: Participatory Budget Cologne</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In November 2009, following the motto of “Your city – your money” a second time, ideas and ratings were collected. About 10.000 citizens of Cologne, Germany, took an active part and offered 1,254 suggestions with 4,664 comments and 38,470 ratings. The top 100 rated suggestions were reviewed for practicability and costs and passed on for a decision. The steps required for implementation can be tracked on the website.<span> </span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Recommendations for successful e-participation projects</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Successful projects all show similar patterns in planning and implementation. Using these patterns as a point of orientation minimizes the project risks. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-US">The phases of information, dialogue and feedback are essential. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-US">The topic needs to be of interest to the citizens and must be tied to their daily lives and environment.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-US">The combination of different participation tools is promising. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-US">Online users need to be taken serious and answers to their concerns should be personal, up to date and formulated concretely. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-US">Precise questions help to avoid insults or general statements of displeasure. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-US">A summary in German can be ordered free of charge at <a href="http://www.neuundkuehn.at/" target="_blank">www.neuUndKuehn.at</a> </span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a short <strong>summary of the contribution to the CEE CN background paper</strong> provided for the PEP-NET on-line consultation &#8220;<a href="http://www.internet-discourse.eu/">eParticipation in Central and Eastern Europe: The big questions</a>&#8220;. </p>
<p>The table (<a href="http://www.inepa.si/images/stories/un-eparticipation-2010-cee-region-inepa.pdf">available in pdf file from the Institute for Electronic Participation web site</a>) representing current United Nations e-participation 2010 index measurement for CEE countries shows, that an average UN e-participation 2010 rank of the CEE region is rank 70th (+24 ranks improvement in relation to 2008) out of 178 countries included in report. </p>
<p>Countries with the highest level of rank improvement are TFYR Macedonia (+ 109), Bulgaria (+ 99), Romania (+ 83), and Albania (+ 66). On the hand, countries like Bosnia – Herzegovina (-37), Ukraine (- 35), Czech Republic (- 26) and Azerbaijan (- 19) are facing the largest position decrease.</p>
<p>Additionally, three sub groups within CEE region can be identified according to the UN e-participation 2010 ranking:</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>High level e-participation countries</em> (among the first 30 countries in the world):<br />
Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary. All countries except Croatia in this group are a new EU member states.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>Medium level e-participation countries</em> (ranking 31-100 in the world): Bulgaria,<br />
Latvia, Ukraine, Republic of Belarus, Poland, TFYR Macedonia, TFYR Macedonia, Romania,<br />
Azerbaijan, Montenegro, Albania, Czech Republic and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>Low level e-participation countries </em>(ranking among least developed countries in<br />
the world): Slovakia, Georgia, Armenia, Bosnia – Herzegovina and Serbia.</p>
<p>Additional data will be presented in the next contribution to the background paper focusing on data comparison with the EU and more detailed explanation in relation to specific e-government components (on-line services, telecommunication infrastructure and human capital) in order to provide basic insight into key eGovernment enablers for eParticipation development in CEE region.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivation and image

Global challenges such as the climate change and the economical crisis do increasingly worry the society. However, satisfying solutions to these challenges are not in sight. More and more people are dissatisfied with the political decisions of the representatives they have elected. One reason for that is the fact that most citizens do not understand the backgrounds and complex correlations of political and economical decisions and feel excluded from the decision-making processes. As a result, citizens are disenchanted with politics and lack civic commitment. In addition, existing possibilities regarding the participation in society and politics are not powerful and influential enough. Particularly young people increasingly lose their belief in democracy and fall into resignation.

These are the reasons for founding echo: echo is a platform for sustainable change and active civic participation and creates a basis for a democracy which is independent from political parties and in which people may participate at a local, regional, and global level. Citizens, experts, politicians, and decision makers in economy and society may discuss their points of view, mobilize fellow campaigners, plan activities together, and put them into practise. echo’s cross-platform approach overcomes the limits of particular portals and initiatives and therefore increases the power of their influence. echo builds on existing legislative instruments and therefore enables civic commitment to convert into true political participation.

echo acts as a social business and is committed to the basic ethical values of democracy as well as to the values of environmentally and socially sustainable economic management. Within the scope of its ‘your profit’ business philosophy, surpluses which are generated in the course of financing echo’s economic viability flow back into projects and ventures of the society. In this way, echo is a sample of a new business culture. When used in companies, its innovative social software directly contributes to strengthening a social and sustainable management style and to democratising existing business and economical structures. echo becomes a multiplier for sustainable ventures and a catalyst of democratic economic activities.

An interdisciplinary team of young and experienced academics forms the background of echo. These people are trained in the technological as well as in the socio-cultural and the economical field. A growing network of organisations, experts, as well as renowned intercessors increasingly supports this core team.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: normal">As we now have been PEP-NET member for about two months, we now finally would like to introduce echo to the ones who may not knows us yet &#8211; better late than never <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>
<h2>Motivation and image</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <strong>powerlessness</strong> and <strong>political resignation</strong> among the population and weakens people&#8217;s faith in democracy. Calls for <strong>transparency</strong> and more <strong>participation</strong> are growing louder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">The current crises can thus be understood as a general <strong>crisis of democracy. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 13.3333px">New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop <strong>constructive solutions</strong> to effectively tackle our “glocal” challenges. This is why echo has been founded: As a platform for sustainable change and <strong>active citizen participation</strong> echo enables a new form of non-partisan participatory democracy on local, regional and global level. With echo the first web-application is being developed to enable <strong>collective intelligence </strong>through democratic discourse even with a virtually unlimited number of participants.</span></span></p>
<p>echo offers a quick overview of  interesting discussions, gives people an opportunity to voice their opinions in a deliberative discourse and to jointly find the right solutions. On echo, people can connect with allies, experts and decision makers and together turn their decision into reality.</p>
<p>echo consists of three clearly separated functional areas, which at the same time are tightly interwoven:</p>
<h2><strong>Discuss, Connect, Act!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Discuss </strong><span>is the core area, which contains most unique features and enables </span><strong>collective intelligence</strong><span> to emerge. The discussions taking place in the discussion area offer a differentiated</span><strong> overview</strong><span> of the different statements edited and supported by certain regions or societal groups.</span></p>
<p>Every statement is edited through a self organized democratic process (without the need of moderators or admins). Thanks to the new <strong>semantic cross-language search engine</strong>, users can find easily a comprehensive selection of relevant information. With only minimal effort thousands of users can contribute to the dynamic evolution of sound statements.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> offers users an easy possibility to organizes their contacts, add interesting experts and opinion leaders their personal network and to connect people with <strong>specific competences</strong> relevant to a certain subject. To enhance usability and foster a viral growth there will be interfaces connecting several external social networks like twitter and facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Act!</strong><span> motivates the participants of discussions to proactively launch actions and projects, to jointly turn their ideas and visions into reality, and thus, make change visible in every day life. To do so, echo offers a virtual work space equipped with the necessary tools and information to efficiently plan and accomplish different kinds of actions and projects and found eco-socially sustainable businesses. </span></p>
<p>As most actions and projects will need funding, echo is based on powerful business models. &#8220;Powerful“ does not merely mean working cost-covering. It also means helping users to provide their actions with the necessary funds. This <strong>enables people to accomplish their goals</strong> and lets their virtual engagement influence our real world in a positive way, which is the key to <strong>motivate ever more people </strong>to participate on echo. Thus, the comprehensive concept of echo has true potential to free people from their sense of powerlessness, offer them a way of <strong>successful self-determination</strong> and help them restore their <strong>faith in democracy</strong>.</p>
<h2>Create Synergies</h2>
<p>In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a <strong>distributed approach</strong> and makes its functionality available throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog. In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and creates <strong>true synergies</strong>, instead of hamstringing competition.</p>
<h4>Shared User- and Opinion Base</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333px">Through cooperation with echo, partner platforms connect their communities with each other. This way, their different user groups are joint together in a single cross-platform community. The users can now connect throughout all platforms, discuss and jointly launch actions and projects.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, echo addresses to users on a larger scale exceeding such groups from existing platforms through an extended network with further organizations. This in turn, multiplies the range and influence of each single partner platform. Projects and campaigns profit from the viral dissemination and its huge and highly motivated community.</p>
<p>Discussions on issues, which are relevant to the different partner platforms can be initiated on any other partner platform, thus, enriching discussions and making them more interesting and alive. This way a much <strong>broader opinion base</strong> is formed, as possibly could emerge on any single platform.  New impulses and issues flow back and forth, enriching discussions and <strong>rising the attractiveness of all partner platforms.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">This thematic diversity – covering different thematic fields and ranging broadly and deeply into society – rises virality enormously. The synergetic effects allow for a common development of content throughout different communities, which offers interesting information to virtually every Internet user. Thus, the influence of the proposals elaborated in this distributed system will boost its influence on society enormously.</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presentation made at the Seminar for Watchdogs held in Warsaw, 11-12th March 2010. The slides are available at the Institute for Electronic Participation web site <a href="http://www.inepa.si/images/stories/eparticipation_watchdogs_eu_delakorda.pdf">http://www.inepa.si/images/stories/eparticipation_watchdogs_eu_delakorda.pdf</a> (pdf, 805 kb).</p>
<p>The presentation is a follow up from a discussion paper <em>E-participation &#8211; a new sphere of NGO activity?</em> originally published in June 2009 at the Trust for Civil Society in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE Trust) Civil Society Forum web site <a href="http://csf.ceetrust.org/paper/19/">http://csf.ceetrust.org/paper/19/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>E-participation &#8211; a new sphere of NGO activity?</strong></p>
<p>A new sphere of NGO activity has emerged in recent years in Slovenia, as a number of NGOs have started to take a more web-based approach. A number of on-line projects have been introduced, such as the Slovenian Civil Society e-Participation web service[1], The Citizen&#8217;s Forum[2], the NGO e-Participation portal available during the Slovenian EU Council Presidency[3], The Citizen&#8217;s forum for the European elections 2009[4], Open-source NGOs e-Participation platform[5] and the e-participation platform for NGO involvement in establishing the Law on voluntary work[6]. These projects aim to strengthen civil dialogue and utilize the internet to support participatory democracy.</p>
<p>Maximizing the impact of this new arena has understandably led to some challenges and dilemmas, for the NGO sector, which we will outline here and will, hopefully, form the basis of further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>The real challenge</strong></p>
<p>A number of ad-hoc e-participation projects and successfully implemented applications are not seeing much traffic or interaction because internet users are simply not paying attention to them. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, the application is intentionally or unintentionally badly promoted to the general public or focus groups. Government institutions are not usually keen to promote on-line participation tools which are already available. They fear a potential rush to participate and management problems. NGOs, on the other hand, often do not have enough resources to promote their e-participation projects on a larger scale, particularly through traditional mass media.</p>
<p>Secondly, the e-participation projects are focused on relatively minor or highly technical expert issues, which may be irrelevant to the general public and their quality of life. If this is the case, NGOs have a duty to explain these complex issues, relate them to everyday life experience. They have to explain to people why the issue is relevant to them and how their participation can improve the situation. Never-the-less, a much more effective way to rally people around e-participation is to base projects on public problems and policy issues, which directly concern a larger proportion of the population.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is often little evidence of how these e-participation projects will impact public opinion or decision-making processes. Potential users do not know how the results of e-participation are going to shape policy issues, problems or public perception. Improving this situation requires feedback from governmental institutions and politicians, monitoring any impact on legislation or changes in public perception of a particular issue and the degree of mass media recognition. E-participation is therefore often more of a political and social challenge than a technological one.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable success</strong></p>
<p>NGO e-participation projects, although not for profit or market-oriented, are often very demanding in terms of both organizational and financial resources. Open-source Internet applications and user friendly web 2.0 applications enable NGOs to establish their own e-participation applications very quickly and with minimum costs. Whether or not an NGO successfully implements e-participation, however, depends on its mobilization capacity, decision-making impact, community building, technical security, personal data protection, moderation of on-line communication, public promotion, monitoring techniques and evaluation methods.</p>
<p>Most of this know-how is needed in order to establish a proper social, communication and political environment for e-participation applications. For example, when moderating an on-line policy forum or consultation, a specific set of rules usually applies to enable deliberate democratic communication and starting questions. Data is usually available to enable informed debate and messages from participants are summarized in a report at the end.</p>
<p>NGOs facilitating e-participation projects often need to have at their disposal expert and in-depth understanding of complex decision-making, policy-making and public opinion forming processes, especially at the level of EU institutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new skills are required when facilitating and building up social networks and communities as a part of e-participation projects. This includes using platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flicker and providing messages through different formats and features on-line. As the most successful e-participation projects are the ones which are most sustainable, NGOs have to provide long-term, diverse human and technological input to keep up with rapidly evolving Internet technology.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinating off-line and on-line participation</strong></p>
<p>The digital divide is often cited as a barrier to e-participation. Older generations are generally less likely to have the proper skills required to use new information and communication technologies. Marginalized groups within society often do not have proper Internet access, allowing it to be dominated by white, well-educated people.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the democratic potential of the Internet is strengthening the political power of those who are already information-rich and empowered. The Internet therefore supports the existing balance of power in favour of political elites.</p>
<p>For these reasons it is vital that e-participation projects implemented by NGOs play a part in real-time processes and are connected to live events and discussions in order to enable the participation of people who are unable to utilize the latest technology.</p>
<p>For example, the on-line Citizens forum for the European elections 2009 enabled e-participation through a system of e-points, positioned at live public events. Facilitated by a moderator, these e-points provided access to laptops. Paper questionnaires were also distributed with the results later published in an on-line debate.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimatizing participation</strong></p>
<p>NGOs deliver both top-down and bottom-up e-participation projects and applications. The first are usually co-financed by government institutions on a local, national or EU level. The second are usually co-financed by the NGO foundations, networks or implemented by NGOs themselves.</p>
<p>As top-down e-participation projects such as e-consultations, e-panels, participatory budgeting and e-legislation are promoted and supported by government institutions, they have a higher degree of public visibility. They are also more likely to impact policy or legislation directly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because these government institutions have a greater degree of ownership over the project, they can hijack the e-participation process and adapt it to their specific goals. These are often related to legitimizing governmental agendas, as was the case with the NGO e-Participation portal for the Slovene EU Council Presidency.</p>
<p>Bottom up e-participation projects such as e-activism and e-campaigning are used by NGOs to coordinate, organize, finance and engage the public. They aim to mobilize and gain support or deliver a political message as a part of political campaigns, as was the case with the Open-source NGOs e-Participation platform.</p>
<p>Grass-roots activities like e-petitions, e-questionnaires, Facebook groups and blogs do not usually represent part of a formal or institutionalized policy-making process and are therefore providing much needed input from citizens in relation to government institutions, based on the principle of participatory democracy. This can, however, sometimes result in conflict with a government or a stalemate in the decision-making process. In order to overcome this kind of dichotomy, a new NGO participatory community multi-media project in Slovenia has been exploring new possibilities for video e-participation 2.0, such as Studio 12)[7].  Top down e-participation is more efficient but bottom up e-participation is more legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for success in e-democracy</strong></p>
<p>NGO e-participation projects in Slovenia clearly demonstrate the democratic value of the Internet, especially when providing information and data related to decision-making process.  This was the case with the Slovene Civil Society e-Participation web service which provided information and opportunities for citizens and NGOs to e-participate in different policy-making processes. Meanwhile, the NGO e-Participation portal for the EU Council Presidency enabled document provision, raising EU policy awareness, strengthening transparency and enhancing public visibility of the Slovene Presidency.</p>
<p>On the other hand the challenges of justifying such initiatives as forms of e-democracy and funding still remain. Firstly, meeting social expectations related to the depth of on-line discussions and deliberation is demanding additional efforts in perceiving Internet technology as a truly interactive technology within decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, the political expectations behind providing concrete evidence of the inclusion of citizen and NGO contributions into final decisions, documents or policies are often not realized. For this purpose a proper evaluation framework or methodology for the effects of e-democracy should be created. The latter is especially important when reflecting on imaginary and fake top down e-participation projects conducted by governments and public relations agencies.</p>
<p><strong>The future of NGO e-participation</strong><br />
A number of challenges therefore remain for NGOs keen to get involved in e-participation. They must develop effective ways of linking on-line and off-line participation, thereby tackling the digital divide.</p>
<p>They must also reflect critically on institutional, top-down public relations and technocratic-oriented attempts at e-democracy introduced by political elites and governments.<br />
Successful examples of NGO e-participation need to be promoted to the general public through the media, thereby creating more public awareness.</p>
<p>Transparency of e-participation, inclusiveness and personal data protection must be secured in order to build confidence and the conditions necessary for e-participation need to be cultivated further.</p>
<p>NGOs need to create focused and sustainable e-participation projects and cement their role as e-participation facilitators.</p>
<p>Finally NGOs need to successfully manage their e-participation resources. They need to build up a catalogue of professional skills in on-line engagement and participatory process management. They need to accept that e-participation needs to appeal to the general public as a means of improving quality of life. E-participation needs to become personal.</p>
<p>E-participation initiatives clearly come with more political and social issues and dilemmas than technological ones. This gives debates on e-participation additional relevance, as they are framed and conceptualized by debates on the future development of political democracy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Eleven international news agencies have launched a joint Facebook page to interact with news consumers across the globe during the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheClimatePool" target="_blank">The Facebook fan page</a>, called The Climate Pool, will bring the news agencies together in an unprecedented collaboration to spark a global conversation about climate issues. The purpose of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheClimatePool" target="_blank">the Facebook hub (http://www.facebook.com/TheClimatePool)</a> will be to engage readers in direct communication with the world-class journalists covering the U.N. conference Dec 7-18.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The agencies have come together for the Copenhagen project under the auspices of MINDS International, a global news agency network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">“The climate summit in Copenhagen will affect the lives of billions of people, and it is likely to grip the attention of news consumers all over the world,” said Wolfgang Nedomansky, managing director of MINDS.  “The Climate Pool will provide a unique outlet for Internet users to discuss climate change with some of the world’s most experienced journalists covering the conference.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier I have written about the Student Union <a title="Student Union Elections" href="https://oeh-wahl.gv.at/Content.Node/33092_3.php" target="_self">elections </a>of May 2009 which were Austria&#8217;s first use of a legally binding electronic voting system.</p>
<p>The <strong>E-Voting system required</strong> the students to authenticate themselves using a citizen card. In Austria this &#8220;citizen card function&#8221; is included in the social security card, which is called <a title="e-card" href="http://www.chipkarte.at" target="_self">e-card</a>. The e-card was launched in March 2005 in order to modernize the old fashioned system of legitimizing the citizen&#8217;s status in front of doctors via the paper version of the &#8220;Krankenschein&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <strong>e-card</strong> has since then been issued 8.5 million times according to the official website. 11.151 partners accept the e-card in doctor&#8217;s practices all over Austria and it has been used 405 million times for this purpose. But the e-card is much more than a tool for more efficient social security administration.<span id="more-530"></span> It can be activated and hence provide citizen card function for its holder. The benefit of this is to ensure secure web access to online banking, to file one&#8217;s income tax statement online, to request a character reference and many more. You could buy a car using the activated e-card, a card reader and your PINs.</p>
<p>Although this system itself is quite well established, security is granted and the usability is good, the citizen card function wasn&#8217;t as distributed and commonly used as it could have been. One of the main reasons for this is, that the real killer application is still missing. The second reason could be the absence of proactive campaigns to distribute the cards and the necessary card reader and to communicate this benefit to the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>In the fore field</strong> of the mentioned E-Voting project, a campaign, named <a title="studi.gv.at" href="http://www.studi.gv.at" target="_self">studi.gv.at,</a> has been started. It was aiming at building up some of the necessary infrastructure. Especially the second objection of lacking campaigns has now been debilitated. The studi.gv.at-campaign really arose awareness for E-Voting and the citizen card amongst the Austrian students. More than 11.500 citizen cards and free card readers have been distributed (before this campaign only about 15.000 citizen cards on the new version of the e-card have been activated throughout Austria).</p>
<p>How was this achieved?</p>
<p><strong>The concept</strong> was simple but effective. The campaign focused on active students to ensure word of mouth to colleagues. For this reason countless info stands were arranged in the universities&#8217; assemblies, the dates were printed on large posters. Student union functionaries were used as multipliers. The appearance focused on the time-saving aspect, social participation and being an early adopter. Scientific expertise has been provided to communicate credibility and trustworthiness. Another key strategy was to use the network of the involved players to further encourage the campaign. 30 Tutors were selected and trained with the ability to educate students so they could activate citizen cards by themselves for friends, colleagues or family members.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> for studi.gv.at was facilitated by the website, a regular newsletter, banners on partner websites and press releases at predefined milestone events. A raffle was also organized giving away trendy i-pods to the lucky winners. Forum threads and &#8220;advertorials&#8221; on universities&#8217; media rounded the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Another lesson learned</strong> is the fact, that the numbers of activated e-cards were steadily increasing, but only by relatively and equally small amounts for the first five months of the campaign. From October 2008 until February 2009 &#8220;only&#8221; 4.800 citicen cards were activated. The rest of the 6.700 cards have been activated in the last three moonths, which is astonishing!<br />
This was achieved by various factors. First of all by the tremendous effort of the engaged promotion partners, which would elsehow wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Second by the medial awareness created and gained by the emotional discussion around E-Voting in Austria. And thirdly by the fact, that such campaigns seem to need some time to build up momentum. People take a while until they get interested, until they care for something new. Getting attention is hard in the beginning, but if you dive through the hard time, it really pays.</p>
<p>All in all the <a title="studi.gv.at" href="http://www.studi.gv.at" target="_self">studi.gv.at</a> campaign is a real success story almost doubling the number activated citizen cards in Austria within months with manageable cost and reasonable effort. It truly boosted Austria&#8217;s &#8220;e-Governability&#8221;.</p>
