				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignright" src="http://pep-net.eu/files/2012/03/Donnerstag_Session-71klein-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />The growth of movements like the Right to the City Movement and protests like Stuttgart21, Gängeviertel, or NO BNQ show the continuously increasing demand for more public participation in urban development. The pilot project <a title="Nexthamburg" href="http://www.nexthamburg.de">Nexthamburg</a> experiments with new ways of public participation in the urban development of Hamburg. The concept of the open and independent crowd-sourcing project will be presented at the PEP-NET Summit on 14th May.</strong></p>
<div>
<p>Nexthamburg gathers solutions and challenges for the city of Hamburg in crowd-<br />
sourcing processes. Citizens can post their own solutions for the big challenges on the webpage or other Nexthamburg social media channels, discuss, comment or follow others, create their own vision for Hamburg. They can also participate in one of the Nexthamburg events, for example Nexthamburg Sessions, Salon, Zukunftscafés, or the Zukunftscamp.</p>
<p>The long-term goal of the project is to organize a crowd-funding channel for promising ideas for Hamburg’s urban development to finance feasibility studies and realization efforts.</p>
<p>Nexthamburg is active since April 2009 and has been promoted as a pilot project of national politics of urban development by the federal ministry for traffic, building, and urban development until 2011. It is supposed to become a non-profit association in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Hands up if you&#8217;ve heard the  term &#8220;Living Lab&#8221; and wondered what it means. Now is your chance to find  out: PEP-NET has invited some living lab experts from across the  continent to take questions on the topic.</strong></p>
<p>On <strong>1<sup>st</sup> November</strong> at <strong>11.00 CET</strong>,  there will be a one-hour live chat with representatives of Turku  University in Finland, Ulster   University, Northern Ireland, and Jesse  Marsh, special advisor to the President of the Council of the European  Living Labs Network.</p>
<p>All panel members (see the list  below) are partners in the European Commission-financed PARTERRE  project, which is assessing the viability of existing spatial planning  consultation services in several European countries outside their  countries of origin, and which is adopting a living lab approach to  integrate them into one spatial planning consultation service.</p>
<p>So we are lucky to have our  Living Lab aficionados in the project, and I have been kind enough to  share them with the rest of PEP-NET!</p>
<p>When the chat starts, you will  see a box on <a title="Live Chat page" href="http://pep-net.eu/live-chats/">the &#8220;live chats&#8221; page</a> (see the tab at the top of the  PEP-NET blog). You will be able to participate by entering your  questions there. Please note that your questions and comments will not  appear immediately, as they are all approved before being published.  This enables us to structure the conversation a little bit, ensuring  that similar topics are discussed together.</p>

<p><strong>As football fans worldwide roar at their televisions, the German Bertelsmann Stiftung is kicking off another prize with arguably more at stake than the World Cup. Has your project found new ways of involving underrepresented citizens? If so, you could be in with a chance of winning the Reinhard Mohn Prize 2011, with prize money of € 150,000!</strong></p>
<p>If you know of a project run by a governmental organisation that deserves to win the Reinhard Mohn Prize 2011, simply visit <a title="Go to the website to nominate a project!" href="http://www.vitalizing-democracy.org/">vitalizing-democracy.org</a> by 22<sup>nd</sup> August to nominate it. You can also discuss projects that have been submitted so far. By the following phase, which lasts until 6<sup>th</sup> October 2010, 20 projects will have been selected and you can continue to discuss them on the website. This will be followed by a public consultation before the prize is presented in June 2011 in Gütersloh,  Germany. The person who nominates the winning project will be invited to the award ceremony.<span id="more-2839"></span>This is not only an opportunity for governmental organisations that have run successful projects: the platform is already attracting a large number of project descriptions from across the world that can serve as inspiration for other organisations that wish to follow their lead.</p>
<p>The Bertelsmann Stiftung renamed the annual Carl Bertelsmann Prize in honour of its founder, Reinhard Mohn, who passed away in October last year. Since being founded in 1977, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has given away around € 666 million to 700 projects. This is your chance to be the next project to benefit.</p>
<p>You can find full details of the eligibility criteria on the website under the “About” section. Please note that although non-governmental organisations can be involved in the delivery of nominated projects, the responsible body must be a governmental organisation and prize money can only be paid to them.</p>
<p>The platform for taking nominations and allowing discussion and rating of projects was created by DEMOS GmbH, a joint venture between TuTech Innovation GmbH and Binary Objects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">Much focus has been on Web 2.0 technology as an enabler for wider dissemination, awareness raising and not least participation and transparency. It is therefore interesting to see that Web 2.0 technologies are being used in various ways for a range of purposes in this year’s 5th Ministerial eGovernment Conference, 18-20 November, in Malmö (Sweden) and 4<sup>th</sup> European eGovernment Awards. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Webcast of conference sessions</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The plenary sessions and three of the parallel sessions at the Ministerial eGovernment Conference will be webcast live and on demand this year from the conference website <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff">.</span> In addition the ceremony for the 4<sup>th</sup> European eGovernment Awards will most likely also be the subject of a webcast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The programme is available on <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/programme"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se/programme</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">In addition to RSS feed, Twitter feed is available onthe Ministerial eGovernment Conference website <a href="http://www.egov2009.se/"><span style="color: #0000ff">www.egov2009.se</span></a>. Participants are actively encourage to Twitter about the Informal Ministerial Meeting on eGovernment and the 5th Ministerial eGovernment Conference to use the hashtag #egov2009.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Online vote for European eGovernment Awards Public Prize</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">Following success of the first online vote in relation to the European eGovernment Awards 2007 in Lisbon (Portugal) the European Commission and the European eGovernment Awards Consortium decided early onto continue practicing what they preach.  The objective has been to: increase the visibility and status of public sector ICT projects in Europe; encourage good practice exchange, and; to encourage active involvement and participating in the European eGovernment Awards by the epractice.eu and wider stakeholder communities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The online voting for the European eGovernment Awards Public Prize was therefore launched late this summer and closed on 11 November at 18:00 CET. Members of the epractice.eu community have been able to vote for their favorite cases from among the 52 European eGovernment Awards 2009 finalists.  The online vote is in addition to other ICT initiative by the awards consortium and the European Commission for a fully electronic submission process via <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/">www.epractice.eu</a> and the remote evaluation of the received submissions by the jury in the first phase of the evaluation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">The voting is now closed but the 52 finalist cases remain published at ePractice.eu and are open to receive members’ comments.  The winner of the Public Prize will be announced at the awards ceremony on 19 November at 18:30 – and likely to the subject of a webcast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Virtual exhibition</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US">For the first time the European eGovernment Awards finalist are accessible online through a virtual exhibition.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On September 15th the <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/">Participatory Budgeting Unit</a>, a project by the <a href="http://www.church-poverty.org.uk/">Church Action against Poverty</a>, organized the <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/news/1st-pb-conference-resounding-success" target="_blank">first National PB conference in Manchester (UK)</a>. For a short introduction to the topic the PB Unit does explain <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/about">Participatory Budgeting</a> and the reasons <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/about/why-do-pb">why it should be</a> done very well on their website. I was at the event as one of the few non UK citizens and therefore had kind of an outsiders look on what is going on over there. I would like to talk about a few of these impressions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first significant fact was that an estimate of 250 representatives of mainly public bodies and councils took part in an event which was focus on what is still a niche topic. This shows that the interest in Participatory Budgeting in the UK is strong and that we can assume that there will be a number of new towns and quarters who start using PB in the next years. I had the opportunity to speak to some of the representatives of cities who already use PB and they were very clear in stating that they will keep up their efforts and that PB has to be a long term process which can not be done “right” at the first try.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span id="more-166"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Secondly the discussion of good practice cases and related inputs by speakers showed that, while all cases are clearly differentiated, PB in the United Kingdom has a number of specific attributes which distinguish it from the efforts in other countries. Most cases focused on finding a certain budget of varying size which can be solely committed to be distributed by citizens. One speaker made the, from my point of view controversial, point that if this distribution is not binding for the decision makers the effort can not be called participatory budgeting at all. It was clear that in this model only a small amount of for example a cities budget can be committed. This way of approaching PB is for example different to some cases in Germany where the whole city budgeting was up to discussion and the results where then fed into the parliamentary discussion (see for example <a href="http://www.beteiligungshaushalt.freiburg.de/demos.php">Freiburg</a> or <a href="http://demos.tutech.de/">Hamburg</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another distinguishing factor was that the PB efforts presented almost exclusively depended on face to face meetings among citizens to decide over the budget in discussion. There seem to be little use of electronic tools and especially the Internet. When talking to attendees is was clear that the use of for example online tools was in their focus and that they were in some cases planning to use these tools in the future especially to get segments of the population involved who are absent in the process right now. It seems to be clear that future PB efforts will have to include different forms of media and channels to reach out to the constituency and that the Internet will be clearly one of them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In conclusion participatory budgeting in gaining steam in the UK and the concepts and ideas get adapted to the local conditions. In certain field however, as for example with electronic participatory budgeting, there seems to be the need to keep innovate and keep and eye on the activities in other countries in Europe and over the world (which is true also in reverse).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">eParticipation good practice cases (D4.2a)</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">eParticipation recommendations (D5.1a) </span></span></span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">As part of the study’s initial analysis of eParticipation practitioner initiatives in Europe 216 cases from 18 countries and in 29 different languages have been identified to date and are initially available on our project website. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The first of three iterations of eParticipation related recommendations is also available now on our project website. At the end of the study the third and final iteration will provide a set of practical, and intellectually rigorous, recommendations. The recommendations aim to answer and specify (mainly at European level) the following:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">What should be done by whom?</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">How this may be achieved?</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">Which types of ICT can be used?</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">How other types of media can be involved? </span></span></span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">However, rather than attempting to provide recommendations at this early stage of the project, this first iteration pose a number of tentative questions. Questions which reflect some of the main lines of enquiry appropriate to the study and may help frame the final recommendations. The questions have arisen as a result of the work carried out to date and the current report may as a result also serve as a partial overview of the study as it currently stands. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="list 36.0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">The next wave of deliverables is foreseen for publication in October/Novermber 2008 and will include updates of all current findings. The second version of the deliverables will therefore reflect the further analysis carried out by the Consortium as well as take into account comments made by the project’s Peer Review Group and the European Commission.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="EN-GB;"><span style="Times New Roman;">All deliverables are available on the publications/public deliverables section of our project website: <a href="http://www.european-eparticipation.eu">www.european-eparticipation.eu</a></span><span style="small;"><span style="Times New Roman;">.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://familie.portal.muenchen.de/" target="_blank">online consultation in Munich</a> concerning the role of families for the city is a prime example of engaging the public authorities in direct communication with the citizens. A profound learning process on the side of the individuals working for public institutions could be observed. In the course of the discussion there were many cases of direct and productive communication between citizens and public officials which led to a deeper understanding for the issues and attitudes on both sides.</p>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<p>The purpose of the discourse was to discuss the state of families in the city of Munich, to collect the attitudes and ideas of parents and couples planning to have children about the situations of live for families in the city, to inform the citizens about the ongoing program to make Munich a more attractive city for families. From May 10th to 31st 2006 the <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/cases/demos" target="_blank">DEMOS </a>method and platform developed by <a href="http://tutech.de/22324714" target="_blank">TuTech </a>was used to fulfill these tasks. A total number of 36 proposals were developed by the participants and will be integrated into the long term plan for policies on children and families.</p>
<p>In 1.533 contributions the 316 registered participants discussed the topic and exchanged useful tips and additional information. The general atmosphere of the discussion was very open and constructive, so that the team of moderators only had to intervene once.</p>
<p>In the first phase (May 10th to 14th) of the three part discussion the main aspects of the topic were identified by the citizens and discussed in general. Already in this phase many innovative ideas and suggestions were articulated by the participants. After the filtering of the main topics by the team of moderators, the discussion went into more specialized sub forums in the second phase (May 15th to 28th). The wiki-technology was used to carry over the discussion into the 36 concrete results mentioned above. In the last phase the discussion was summarized and additional information was added to the results.</p>
<p>In summary the project fulfilled the given tasks and produced a number of concrete results that are brought into the process of political decision making. Especially the intensive exchange of information and arguments both among citizens and between citizens and public officials was a major advantage for the city of Munich.</p>
