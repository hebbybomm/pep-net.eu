		<description>Thanks John. Is it fair to say that keeping things simple is important, as well as thinking about what you can realistically ask of citizens and what you need staff to do?</description>

		<description>Householders have a major job to do in terms of segregating different waste streams but it would be naive to believe that they do it accurately.  

While there are few problems in correctly segregating paper and cardboard, plastics represent a huge gap in understanding a capability.  Even if householders knew how to identify polypropylene in their waste, would they know whether their local recycling facility could accept it?  

That gap in knowledge means that a significant amount of time and money is spent by the recycler in segregating further the plastic recycling stream to eliminate products which can&#039;t be easily recycled.</description>
