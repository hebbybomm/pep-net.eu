		<description>&lt;b&gt;&quot;College of the Americas&quot; and &quot;Asociación Ciudades Kyosei&quot; offer a virtual course on Public Participation and (e)Participation&lt;/b&gt;

After a successful completion of the first edition of the course during the last summer (see evaluations below), the Interamerican Network on eGovernment (RIF-GE) is offering a new edition of its virtual course on &quot;Public Participation and digital media&quot;.

The course will take place between the 2nd of May and the 24th of June (8 weeks). Most of the course participants will surely come from Latin-American countries. But as long as you are able to read Spanish... you&#039;ll be able to use English or Portuguese for your assignments and your participation in the fora.

More information and registration in the web of COLAM:

Some of the evaluation comments from students of the course&#039;s 1st edition:

- &quot;Personally I loved the course because it gave us practical and theoretical elements and split my vision of public participation in two: before, and after the course. I believe that before the course, I had an overly linear and institutional idea of public participation. After the course I understand that public participation is fluid and must be promoted in all environments. The resources of the course , the qualified participation of the course peers, the exercises we did... I really thrived on all activities.&quot;
- &quot;This course really exceeded my expectations and I&#039;m not, at the moment, prepared for some of the challenges proposed in it. I am, however, more than satisfied: I saw a big door get open... and I will go inside.&quot;
- &quot;Excellent course content. Excellent tutor engagement. I think the way materials are presented is very good, as well as the diversity of resources and the originality of the teaching contents. An extraordinary course.&quot;
- &quot;I think the teaching dynamics created by the tutors have been one of the best I have experienced in my life. The course has been developed for the web and considers several online tools for learning. The videos are simple and spectacular.&quot;
- &quot;The teaching materials that are provided have, on my view, an excellent level, because of their deep insights and their diversity. The most valuable insight I take away from the course is the recognition of the potentials of citizen involvement, and the awareness that one shouldn&#039;t underestimate the difficulties to achieve it. I have now a good theoretical and practical treasure, which I will tap into in the near future, to get the most of it.&quot;
- &quot;There is much to develop yet, but I started the course with beautiful and utopian ideas [on public partipation] and leave the course with stories, practices, tools, theoretical base... in short, much more than I had, and with a deeper and more critical understanding of the fundamental importance of reactivating the civil society and promoting citizen involvement in the democratic process.&quot;
