		<description>apparently most of European Govts and PA&#039;s are still not aware of challenges and chances of social media. The same impression has Andrea DiMaio, analyst at Gartner who is just as you blogging about the symposium.

PA&#039;s &quot;seem to be unwilling to challenge the status quo and to believe that anything can happen from the bottom-up and from the outside-in. (...) So after two days in Cannes, my statement about North Americans being more likely than Europeans to get government 2.0 is even more valid. I hope my last day in Cannes tomorrow will give me hope, as I believe European citizens and government employees are using social media as much as their North American counterparts and denial will not help for long&quot; http://bit.ly/11Xq8B 

Maybe you should have a word with him and tell him about the best practice cases in Europe...</description>
