		<description>Personally, and I do think, the traditional participation practicioners strongly agree with the basics of this article. E- was sold out. That is the key message, and it has become obvious, such as the gap between practicioners and the e(xperts). In the evolution of technology, it is clear, that how the language of science behaves, it is not supporting knowledge transfer - rather puts it into a closed box. It's identity is the difficultyness of understanding. Why should be other way? Since most of our scientist has come out of traditional universities, where knowledge meant the skill to preserve and keep your knowledge in house rather than sharing it.
Hopefully, this new culture demistifying e-s brakes these myths, and at least for the everyday citizen, it will be no doubt, that the letter (e) is not an add(e)d  value, but something, which is reflecting some dark age of communication science's. How many extra papers do we have to print becasue of this and similar like logical dead-ends? We shall at least now recognize, that if we, humans are electric humans (although quite weak), there is no need to distract our universe by the e term. Now obviously it is connecting everybody - wheter uses e or not, we participate in the same space, which is still infinite..</description>

		<description>Hi all! I agree the most of remarks of this post, in particular in my professional context I'm trying  to connect the practitioner of traditional participation with the "E" world...I can say that the lack of trust in the other is bidirectional...We need, all, to have a neutral and modest approach because we ( who is involved in eParticipation projects) could give some new opportunity to integrate and enriche, sometime very goods, the results in the traditional way to involvment of citizens.</description>

I especially like the mathmatic demostration. Right down my alley of humour.</description>
