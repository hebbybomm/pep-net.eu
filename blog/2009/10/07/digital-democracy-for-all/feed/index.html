		<description>This post reminds me of the eternal conflicting concepts of &quot;neutrality&quot; and &quot;impartiality&quot; in public law and public administration. When bringing the concept of &quot;neutrality&quot; when talking about politics or international relations, one can argue that getting involve in politics or political field in a scientific or an advising role can we be &quot;neutral&quot;, can we conceive the IMF, the World Bank or the UN as &quot;neutral&quot; ? Are public administrations &quot;neutral&quot; in relation to the elected decision-makers if we take the European model of public administration? Don&#039;t these organisations provide experts advises or judgements to the States for the former and the political level for the latter?

In fact they are not &quot;neutral&quot; but &quot;impartial&quot; and in the field of Internet and Politics, as a new and evolving field, similar concepts or norms should be adopted so professional as much as in the political marketing and campaign consultants should be &quot;impartial&quot; in delivering their services. If Tom advises the Conservative Party it does not make him a Torry, as much as it did not become a Labour Member when he adviced the Prime-Minister for his ePetition system.

Internet opened up new possibilities for our social activities, but one should not forget that these new tools are there to enhance our reality and build on its concepts, rules, ethics and processes to better reinvent them...</description>

		<description>@Hans - which would be a good thing

@Julia: right, but: there is still a difference in consulting a labour led government or consulting a political party</description>

		<description>Yes - the impartiality of MySociety is an obvious point.  But, as you say Rolf, MySociety is an independent organisation staffed by extremely independent minded pioneers and Tom is acting as an advisor in an independent capacity.  I appreciate that there are genuine appearance issues - but I must say that I find the criticism from someone like Tom Watson who has been a major and important advocate of digital engagement for years now and has himself benefited from independent advice in the field somewhat counter productive.....</description>

		<description>&quot;There&#039;s no such thing as a free lunch&quot; and I believe any party which appoints someone like Tom as an &#039;unpaid advisor&#039; will face the challenge to make their promises real.</description>

		<description>Thanks Julia for making us aware of that really interesting discussion. First of all I totally agree that the use of the Internet to improve democracy is politically neither left or right nor attached to any of the political parties. However, to become an advisor for one of the parties will have consequences for Tom’s credibility towards the others. The interesting questions is whether this will impact the standing of mySociety in general. In this regard Tom said: “Apart from anything else, I don’t have the power to make mySociety be anything else other than impartial – the staff and volunteers are way too independent minded to allow a dubious change in direction”. This sounds convincing to me and I really hope to others as well.
