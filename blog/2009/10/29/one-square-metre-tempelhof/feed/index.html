		<description>It is a great idea - just thinking about why we haven´t had it. It would be participation, political education, transparency and above all it would be very courageous of the Berlin Senate to try this. It would be a big logistic challenge to build a functioning system to manage all of this - but it would be worth a try. And it would be a fantastic chance for the City of Berlin to proove what a Berlin politiciuan asserted: &quot;Berlin is the capital of participation.&quot; That´s not yet true, but with this idea they would have the chance to become the leader. So, let´s do it!!!</description>
