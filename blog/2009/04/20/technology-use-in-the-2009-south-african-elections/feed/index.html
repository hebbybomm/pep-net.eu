		<description><![CDATA[Anna Kelly (a Swedish colleague) point out earlier today (on Facebook) that  a number of swedish parties have been inspired by Obama&#039;s 2008 election campaign to make more use of social networks and ICT tools. 

The inspiration comes at a apt time with the European Parliament elections looming on the horizon. 

As with any election the main motivational factor is a wish to canvas the electorate and gain their votes and secondly to bring out the vote. Most Swedish campaign managers point out that social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube are particular important in this regard as these are the mediums which have the highest number of users and those the prime focal areas for potential online canvassing. 

For those of you who understand Swedish DN.se published an article on the topic: www.dn.se/fordjupning/europa2009/svenska-partier-harmar-obamas-webbkampanj-1.850428]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting and thank you for the reference to the Indian elections. Will be intersting to see that mobile technolgy, like cell phones and sms&#039;s in particular, are become increasingly used in developing economies. Truth of the matter is that cell phones have achieved far greater levels of penetration (compared to the internet) across the globe and are getting increasingly effective for networking, organisation (social, professionally, politically), informtion sharing and distribution - and not only among the younger generations but also marginalised communities and groups like rural areas, women, the elderly etc.]]></description>
