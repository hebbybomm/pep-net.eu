		<description>Simon is right, the Austrian eDem09 is earlier. A combined event / week is an interesting idea worth discussing.

		<description>I believe the e-dem 09 conference (in Vienna this time, not Krems) will be a bit earlier: 7-8 September, so perhaps next year there will be less of a clash?</description>

		<description>As one of the organisers of one of these events, I heartily endorse your sentiments Rolf.

The problem is, it is hard to shift the date of an annual event by too much as it alters the planning process too much.

We could make our event slightly earlier or later to suit the e-democracy community - perhaps a little later, to the end of November next year, might help. Happy to do that - then if the organisers of the Issy and Krems events could shift theirs a little earlier there would be much more separation.

cheers,

		<description>@ Despina Babbage

Our department is exclusively concerned with eParticipation, eDemocracy and eGovernment projects. We have developed an eParticipation platform and a methodology for result orientated Internet discourses called DEMOS.

We have realised eParticpation projects in Germany for the cities of Hamburg, Munich, Freiburg and Berlin. We have also some experiences in Europe, e.g. in Austria, Greece, Italy and the UK.The main themes are participatory urban planning (http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/?p=122), participatory budgeting (http://demos-budget.eu/) and family friendly cities.

We are (or have been) also involved in different projects partly financed by the EU like DEMOS, LexiPation, TELL-ME and PEP-NET. I will send you some more information via eMail,

Bests,

Rolf</description>

		<description>Hi Chris,

The PEP-NET calendar tries to up to date also. Perhaps we should merge the two?

		<description>Exactly!!

This is really a shame ...
We are such a small community (compare to other fields of &quot;expertise&quot;) yet we manage to put half of all years events in just a month ! many of which overlapping !

I don&#039;t care who will do this but we need a common forecast planning calendar!!

I tried to do a google calendar compilation of existing events at least but I fear many events are not in there ...
