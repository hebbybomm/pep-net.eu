		<description>I also enjoyed the event, though I agree with you, Rolf, that the plenary sessions were rather formal, with little time for questions. It&#039;s also a pity that all the workshops were crammed into two one-and-a-half your slots on each morning. I would have liked to attend more of them!
The session on eParticipatory budget was certainly a highlight. I chatted afterwards to Dan Jellinek of Headstar (one of those people I knew only virtually before Issy-les-Moulineaux), and we wondered why the UK pilots presented by Ruth Jackson from the Participatory Budgeting Unit are so far taking place only at neighbourhood scale, in contrast to the city-wide experiments in Germany, Spain and Italy. Does this betray a lack of commitment from UK government to participatory democracy? My own view is that starting at a very small scale is not a bad approach, particularly in a country like the UK with a very centralised public administration, but it clearly needs to feed into city-wide decision-making processes at some stage, and maybe this is where eParticipation tools will prove useful. Which actually sounds a lot like the Brazilian approach, as described to us by Tiago Peixoto.</description>
