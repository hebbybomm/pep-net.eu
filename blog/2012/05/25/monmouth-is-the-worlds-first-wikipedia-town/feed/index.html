		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really see that NFC chips have so many advantages over QR codes. One of the barriers, as you mention, is that QR reading apps aren&#039;t &quot;native&quot;, so you have to go looking for one in an appstore. But integrating QRs more tightly, e.g. installing a QR reader app by default and making it available directly from the lock screen, would mean that more people use them. This would presumably be cheaper than integrating RFC chips, which makes QR codes more appealing at the cheaper end of the market and this is of particular relevance for inclusive eParticipation.

Then there&#039;s the issue of convenience and cost of creating QR codes vs. NFC chips. It&#039;s a lot easier to print a hundred posters with QR codes on them than to stick an NFC chip onto each of them, and also a lot cheaper, which is an advantage for smaller voluntary organisations and the public sector.

What applies to both of them is the correct usage, as outlined in my article. I suppose NFC chips are a little more convenient in that you just have to swipe rather than take a photo.

Thanks for commenting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally I&#039;m not convinced about the future of QR - particularly with the advent of widespread NFC which is native, much easier to interact with and far more interactive.

I&#039;ve already started to play and am very impresed with the potential for eParticipation - http://particitech.com/?p=699]]></description>
