				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In modern democracies, people are to be empowered by means of information and communication technologies. Transparency and access to data, new ways of interacting with government and democratic institutions cause profound changes in society. Social media and the new forms of societal behaviour, including content generation, collaboration and sharing as well as network organisation change our understanding of politics and business. Governmental and private internet services have increased the citizens’ independence and flexibility. However, enthusiastic ideas and projects often failed to produce the expected results as technology is only the basis for new forms of organisation and interaction. CeDEM12 seeks to critically analyse present and future developments in e-democracy and open government. &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/cedem" target="_blank">http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/cedem</a></p>

<li>Gain visibility with our community and our competition partner, Google.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of four US $5,000 cash prizes in unrestricted funding to boost your project.</li>
<li>Consideration for an Ashoka Fellowship—complete with a three-year living stipend, international recognition, and access to a network of systems-changing social entrepreneurs.</li>
</ul>
