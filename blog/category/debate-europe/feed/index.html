				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can political communication via the Internet and e-participation contribute to the emergence of aEuropean public sphere?</strong></p>
<p>Workshop at the European Parliament, Brussels, 26 May 2011, 9-13 hrs, Room JAN 4Q1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop is meant to reflect on the potentials and realistic prospects of Internet-based applications to contribute to the democratic practices of the evolving political system of the European Union and the formation of a European public sphere. There are examples of cases where positive effects of the Internet concerning the political process are visible, including e-consultations, e-petitions and other initiatives to encourage citizens’ participation. However, it becomes clear that not all of the potentials of the new technology have been realised so far and that apart from technical aspects, there are different legal, political and social issues which need to be addressed in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong> <!--[endif]--></strong></span><span lang="EN-GB">As the European Citizens Initiative (ECI) has now come to the phase of its final shaping, we now have the chance to contribute to its success in being a tool for true citizens participation in European politics. However, current discussions on the regulations drafted by the Commission do show some confusion about what this legislative instrument actually can provide and which risks it contains. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Generally ECI is understood as an instrument for decision-making or voting, as we know it from direct democratic instruments like referenda. Thus, the main use of ICT for the ECI is seen in the authentication and collection of votes (e-voting).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in fact ECI is not essentially a means for decision-making. Its legal consequences are limited to submission of proposals to the Commission, which in turn is not even obligated to pass this proposal to the parliament. Thus, ECI does only allow citizens to participate in political agenda setting and rather has to be understood as a process of collective opinion formation. Accordingly, current discussions on authentication and representativeness miss to address the crucial questions at stake, because ECI is not comparable to an election or referendum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However, this does not mean that ECI is not worth anything. As an instrument for participatory agenda setting, ECI does offer citizens an opportunity to deliberate on questions, which they feel concerned about and to proactively bring them on the political agenda. ECI could open a space for trans-cultural, trans-border discourse embracing all the different viewpoints Europeans from various member states may have, and thus, has the potential to establish a European public sphere. It is about creating a process of discursive appropriation of Europe by its citizens, making them co-authors of the European endeavour. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus, ECI must be understood much more as a participatory process, requiring an intelligent and consistent combination of offline and online methods for constructive collaboration at local, national and European level. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Furthermore, to prevent ECI from being misunderstood as a mere oppositional instruments, it will be equally important to guarantee a synergic interplay between civil organizations and governmental institutions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, further concretion and development of ECI must focus much more on the participative process of collective opinion formation and deliberative agenda setting. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Accordingly, the role of ICT in these processes has to be reconsidered. We will not only need e-voting systems and virtual IDs, but also powerful tools for cross-language dialogue, structured debate, collective co-creation of proposals and position papers as well as tools for effective e-campaigning and proactive self-organization.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to the UK election communication experts predicted an „<a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/977198/Comms-chiefs-predict-first-internet-election-UK/" target="_blank">internet election</a>“. In the aftermath of the election, varying conclusions on the effect of e-campaigning have been drawn. A review of opinions.</p>
<p><span id="more-2566"></span><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7113351.ece" target="_blank">Times: TV-debates were crucial<br />
</a>The voters had not even had the chance to make their vote when the Times delivered its verdict: The TV debates ruled the election campaigns. 140 characters on Twitter were not quite enough to be a key factor, states the Times. Hardly any politician had been able to capitalise on the possibilities offered by the internet. Nevertheless, something was different this time around, probably due to the web: Parties and politicians found it much more difficult to set the agenda. Instead they had to deal with the topics the people forced them to talk about, says the Times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/04/new-digital-battlefield-old-politics" target="_blank">Guardian: Parties missed their chances</a><br />
In the Guardian the digital strategist of Obama´s successful presidential campaign, Joe Rospars, expresses his believe that the parties have not been able to use the internet properly. They just changed the battlefield, not the tactics. Rospars points out that some independent organizations have shown how to do it. The initiative „<a href="http://action.hopenothate.org.uk/content/2010-elections" target="_blank">hope not hate</a>“ for instance sought to prevent candidates of the British National Party from winning seats in the parliament. They organized most events via the internet. An example: Several hundred volunteers handed out 100.000 protest newspapers in two suburbs of London. In both election districts the nationalists fell considerably short of winning a mandate. According to Rospars the secret of the initiative´s success was their skill to transport clear instructions in their messages – and not to lose itself in woolly words. In Rospars`opinion they showed the strong leadership the parties did not deliver.<br />
<a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/rospars-failure-britains-post-obama-internet-election" target="_blank"><br />
TechPresident: Not enough time?</a><br />
TechPresident´s Nancy Scola, in response to Rospar´s analysis, identiefies the short period of time left for the partys&#8217; electoral campaign as a key factor for unsuccessful e-campaigning. Wheras Obama had nearly two years to optimize his strategy, in Britain there was hardly one month left between the announcement of the election date and the polling day. Additionally, Scola assumes that Obama´s web-campaign perfectly matched his image, a fact that might have played a vital part in the campaign´s success.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/advertising-how-did-it-influence-this-election-1965692.html" target="_blank">Independent: Tweets of the day</a><br />
The Independent compares internet and television with the classic poster ad. The results of the web-campaigns may have been disappointing, but nevertheless they spiced up the controversies between the contestants. Furthermore, the newspaper collected the best tweets of the election day. A rather radical message was for instance posted by the journalist Alex Wood: „Remember, everytime someone votes for David Cameron, a puppy dies.“</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/05/so_was_it_an_internet_election.html" target="_blank">BBC: Web not ineffective at all</a><br />
The BBC´s Rory Cellan-Jones firmly believes that the internet played an important role ahead of the election day. Especially young voters got involved with politics thanks to the web. The tie between the election commission and facebook helped to raise the number of first-time voters registering to vote, says Cellan-Jones. And the parties used the web for internal communication and organisation: The extensive usage of e-mail made f2f-staff meetings dispensable.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Grants  for Greece &#8211; Where does our money flow?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:  justify">Author:  Professor Dr. Jörn von Lucke</p>
<p style="text-align:  justify">In times of a global  financial and economic  crisis, the U.S. State of Texas might be a role  model. Susan Combs,  Comptroller of the State of Texas, is a pioneer for  more transparent  budgets. Since 2007, the portal &#8220;Cash Drill:  Transparency at Work&#8221; has  enabled all citizens and the press to  evaluate the state budget of Texas  and to analyze it according to  various criteria (Cash Drill: <a href="http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/expendlist/cashdrill.php">http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/expendlist/cashdrill.php</a>).   Various search tools are available under the &#8220;Where the Money Goes&#8221;   banner. They help to create spending overviews by agency, by category,   by vendors and by purchasing items. Additionally, comparisons of   previous expenditures are possible with the planned budget of an agency.   Such an evaluation is made possible through a data warehouse that   contains these information accessible in multiple languages. Citizens   also have the opportunity to communicate their experiences, impressions   and to give tips for suspected corruption directly.<span id="more-2507"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:  justify">In recent  weeks, Greece was hit  dramatically by the financial crisis. Corruption  in politics and  administration, mismanagement, fraud, tax evasion, and  falsification of  official statistics have contributed to the  downgrading of Greek  government bonds to a &#8220;junk level.&#8221; <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />By the end of 2012, the Hellenic Republic is expected to need   more than 120 billion Euros in financial assistance. To ensure the   stability of the Euro, Germany will have to play a significant part. A   guarantee of the KfW Bankengruppe (&#8220;Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau&#8221;)   appears to all parties as useful and the only option &#8211; which is right.   As a taxpayer, we may regret this. Nevertheless, we should seize the   hour. In times of crisis, the window of opportunity, in which a   substantial change from all sides might be accepted and sustainably   implemented, is small; this is nearly impossible in prosperous times.</p>
<p style="text-align:  justify">If  German tax money is used for guarantees  in Greece, the German taxpayer  should also be able to know where the  money goes. A Greek Cash Drill  portal could inform us and especially the  Greek people how politics and  public administration are currently  dealing with the existing  resources and tax money. Information on fraud,  corruption and nepotism  resulting from the common review of this fully  transparent budget,  could be used by authorities. The Greek press and  the Greek population  might be hold accountable for exactly this task.  Just in the spirit of  crowd sourcing, this all depends on the knowledge  and participation of  the masses. Technically, such a portal, as the  example shows in Texas,  would be quite quickly implementable in several  languages. In terms of  open government such a mandatory requirement for a  financial aid  package would fit in the new public management strategy  of the Greek  Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou. Now it is up to the  negotiators,  whether they can claim a genuine and transparent budget for  a stable  currency, or if they fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:  justify">Admittedly, our eyes should  not only wander  to Greece. The financial crisis has also reached  Portugal, Spain,  Ireland and Italy. Here too, we have to ask the  question, how far an  open and transparent budget could help to win back  trust and confidence  in banks, business, politics and administration.  Even in Germany, we  should no longer close ourselves to this  discussion. The federal  government, the states government, cities and  municipalities are equally  called to start the action. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
