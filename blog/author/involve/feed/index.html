				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are online forums dominated by techies and geeks and, if so, does  this deter wider citizen participation?</p>
<p><span style="#000000;">The European Citizens&#8217; Consultation 2009 (ECC09) might provide an  interesting case study. ECC09 is an ambitious project which is seeking  the views of the citizens of Europe on the economic and social future  of the EU. The overarching aim is to involve citizens of EU member  states in discussion on its economic and social future, bringing  citizens closer to Europes institutions and creating the space for  citizen voices in the European policy making process. Involve are  not-for-profit participation specialists and are the UK National  Partner for the ECC09 project.</span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">The project has three main stages </span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">(1) the online stage </span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">(2) the  National Consultation </span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">(3) the European Citizens&#8217; Summit. </span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">Stages (2)  and (3) are both offline featuring face-to-face deliberation between  randomly selected citizens. The online stage (1) on the other hand is  open to all citizens, MEPs, pressure groups and NGOs and requires  participants to be self-selecting. </span></p>
<p><span style="#000000;">At Involve, we are interested to see who will take part in the online  discussion and at what stage in the project they do so. While in-depth  knowledge of European issues is not a prerequisite for joining the  discussion, the citizens posting in the first instance have tended to  polarise debate, limiting discussion to single issues with strongly  pro-Europe or Eurosceptics slant. Will this stimulate wider discussion  in the long term or will the dominance of geeks create a barrier to  &#8220;lay&#8221; citizens to joining the debate? A number of MEPs have  contributed their visions for the economic and social future of Europe  which are easily accessible for people not schooled in the mechanics  of the EU and it will be interesting to see whether the Party  political dimension of MEP contributions will stimulate citizens, who  are otherwise not motivated by techie talk, to contribute their own  ideas about the future of Europe. The online debate runs throughout  the duration of the project. You can view and join the debate at  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.european-citizens-consultation.org.uk/">www.european-citizens-consultation.org.uk</a></span></p>
