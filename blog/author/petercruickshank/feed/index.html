				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last the last few days, I&#8217;ve been wondering how people involved in e-participation approach open source for their software. The rest of this post is taken up with a whole list of questions -  it&#8217;d be great to hear what people in our community think.</p>
<p>My starting point is an item Bengt Feil posted here last year:<a title="Permanent Link: Uniting the Open Source efforts in eParticipation" rel="bookmark" href="../blog/2008/07/29/uniting-the-open-source-efforts-in-eparticipation/"> &#8220;Uniting the Open Source efforts in eParticipation&#8221;</a>. Some of the responses at the time were interesting &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure if any clear conclusion emerged, so I thought I&#8217;d raise the subject again.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two issues to think about: First, what open source applications are there out there that can be used to support e-participation (eg Drupal, WordPress, Joomla) &#8211; and I can see the need for a directory somewhere where people can their their usefulness in our field, and to discuss which modules and add-ins to use, and how to configure them.</p>
<p>It would be good to hear if there is conclusion on where the best catalog/rating system was. Have the <a title="DEMO-Net" href="http://www.demo-net.org/">DEMO-Net</a> virtual resource centre&#8217;s <a title="list of tools" href="http://www.demo-net.org/data/eparticipation-tools">list of tools</a> or the <a title="FSF Directory" href="http://directory.fsf.org/">FSF Directory</a> which were mentioned in response to Bengt&#8217;s posting proved useful? What about using epractice.eu&#8217;s <a id="qr3b" title="e-particpation community" href="http://www.epractice.eu/community/eParticipation">e-participation community</a> or the <a href="http://www.european-eparticipation.eu/">European e-Participation portal</a>?</p>
<p>Second, there is releasing new or specialist e-participation applications as opensource. This was the area I am most interested in right now.</p>
<p>In my limited experience, it can happen that a project (or vendor) say their code is opensource, but in practice it can be difficult to actually find the code to download&#8230;</p>
<p>(I should point out that there is no obligation to release opensource source-code to the general public: the EUPL/GPL only requires that the source code is supplied to people who pay for the application, so there is no legal issue here, just one of best practice)</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m most interested in right now is this: where where should we as e-participation practitioners and developers register or upload specialist OSS e-participation applications? To pick an obvious example, if code is aimed at European e-participation users, what do you think about the <a id="gor." title="EUPL" href="http://www.osor.eu/eupl">EUPL</a> and using <a id="hbu4" title="OSOR" href="http://www.osor.eu/">OSOR</a> as a repository, is it just another a place to advertise your code, or would you make fuller use of it?</p>
<p>If not there, what would you use? Is it actually of any benefit for there to be access at the CVS/SVN level, or is it enough to just have a compiled package to download?</p>
<p>As a final point on managing the development and release of opensource application, the &#8216;<a id="ani0" title="single-vendor/commercial open source" href="http://dirkriehle.com/publications/2009/the-commercial-open-source-business-model/">single-vendor/commercial open source business model</a>&#8216; as described by Dirk Riehle seems seems quite interesting as a way of bringing in the community while also allowing a development company to retain a revenue stream. Have you heard of it? What do you think?</p>
<p>That will do for now &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to give myself a crash-course where our (e-p) community is going with opensource, and to get an idea how important it really is to us in practice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d appreciate any comments or examples of what&#8217;s worked for you.</p>
