				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear PEP-net community!<br />
neu&amp;kühn is a new PEP-net associate member and we want to take the chance to introduce ourselves. We’re happy to find such a large network of e-participation supporter like us here. <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong><br />
neu&amp;kühn is a companion and developer of online projects with public participation.</p>
<p>With an active interest in e-participation, we provide advice for politics, administrations and institutions in the German-speaking area, especially in Austria, where we strive to clear-up a lot of the common fears and misconceptions that are associated with the topic of citizen participation.</p>
<p><span id="more-3461"></span></p>
<p>We, Kirsten Neubauer and Peter Kühnberger, founders of neu&amp;kühn, have been working together for many years on designing, implementing, marketing and editorial support of online projects in public and semi-public areas.  Among other projects, we were heavily involved in the development and implementation of the official Austrian online help service www.help.gv.at.<br />
We did several publications about e-participation,</p>
<ul>
<li>in March 2010 a comparison of 30 international e-participation projects (<a href="http://pep-net.eu/blog/2010/04/27/study-best-practice-e-participation-in-austria-in-german/">the PEP-net article can be found here</a>) and</li>
<li>most recently  “Town-hall 2.0“ („Rathaus 2.0 – Punkten in Zeiten knapper Budgets“), which serves as a e-participation guideline for administrations and communities in Austria on how to increase acceptance of budget-cuts, bring up new ideas  and strengthen citizen  solidarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A summary of the study and the guide (unfortunately only in German) can be ordered free of charge at <a href="http://www.neuundkuehn.at/kontakt" target="_blank">www.neuundkuehn.at/kontakt</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gov2.0Camp Vienna</strong><br />
For several weeks we have been pushing and supporting the first Gov2.0Camp that will be held in Vienna, Austria on December 3rd 2010. The goal of the Gov2.0Camp is to further an exchange between administration and internet-knowing users and to promote the topic of e-participation in Austria.</p>
