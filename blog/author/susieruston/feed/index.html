				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="Calibri;">Last week many popular </span><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/michael-jackson-s-death-pushes-internet-to-limits-611501"><span style="Calibri;">news sites</span></a><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;"> (CNN, BBC, techradar etc.) reporting the unexpected death of pop legend Michael Jackson caused a world-wide slow down of the Internet which caused many popular engagement channels such as Twitter to crash!<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;"><span style="Arial;">His death generated the most tweets per second on Twitter since Barack Obama was elected president.</span><span style="black;"> In fact many of my friends in remote locations at festivals such as Glastonbury (UK) learned of the shocking news through SMS and Twitter on their mobiles, Blackberry’s and iPhones as cyberspace began to go into frenzy. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">This event raised many fundamental issues about the capacity of the internet that is critical to participation and democracy, as well as highlighting the global difference in how countries trust official and unofficial sources of information<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">For example, the “Michael Jackson outage” on the net (caused by the West accessing many ‘official’ sources of trusted information) resulted in many users who were finding the tool critical for organising protest in Iran unable to access their usual sources of ‘unofficial’ information, thereby effectively delaying demonstrations.<span style="yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">Ironically, despite the mainly unsuccessful efforts of the Iranian regime to shut down participation in the form of protests by denying citizens access to technology, it was actually the West who temporarily (albeit unintentionally) succeeded in achieving this feat through its overuse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="black;"><span style="small;"><span style="Calibri;">A clash of hunger for knowledge from official sources vs. the need to organize knowledge against official sources does raise interesting contrasts and demonstrates how far new media has the ability to focus our thoughts and actions in a modern world. </span></span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="Calibri;">Facebook has had a bad week with five different security issues coming to light.<span style="yes;">  </span>Hackers are coming up with new ways to steal valuable data from users by manipulating the trust and social links that drive the network.<span style="yes;">  </span>The latest being the posting of a fake YouTube link within profiles which releases a malicious malware when clicked. (</span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7918839.stm"><span style="Calibri;">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7918839.stm</span></a><span style="Calibri;">)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="Calibri;">So how do we stay social online whilst protecting ourselves? A 2006 study by Awad and Krishnan noted that whilst users will express very strong concerns about the privacy of their personal information, they will be less than vigilant about safeguarding it. A statement that possibly reflects my own use. As a non-techy-type I know not to include my date of birth in a public online space, but am I being too trusting by providing other personal information in the pursuit of social interaction?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="justify;"><span style="Calibri;">With the upsurge of these hard-to-spot attacks, do I need to do more to protect my own data, or do we need Social Network sites to have higher levels of protection mechanisms and policies to protect members?<span style="yes;">  </span>Or, will measures like these affect the use of the sites?</span></p>
