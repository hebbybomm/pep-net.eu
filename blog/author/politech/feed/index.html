<p class="MsoNormal">It’s not surprising that any kind of a project has a set of risks that can impair the project’s results. eParticipation projects can be especially exposed to a number of<span> </span>various risks, ranging from poor platform developments, which don’t meet users’ requirements and preferences, to inadequate communication strategies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Therefore, developing a risk management plan in the early stage of a project is crucial. It allows to identify certain risks, to analyse them and to develop early strategies and solutions that will help in either minimizing their impact on a project or completely avoiding them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, the identification of risks at the beginning of a project is not enough, because additional risks might arise during the duration of the project or the proposed solutions and strategies to overcome them might prove to be ineffective. Thus, a continuous tracking and control of such risks is very much desirable.<span> </span>In this respect, the Continuous Risk Management (CRM) paradigm developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University (<a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/risk" target="_blank">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/risk</a>) can be a valuable strategy. It doesn’t only allow for continuous risk identification and management, but it also helps in assessing risk exposure by combining the impact and probability of the risk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Argument visualisation might not be seen as a suitable tool for eParticipation at first sign. However, when properly deployed, it can serve as a useful tool for eParticipation projects, where citizens can engage in stimulating brainstorming, exchange of information and knowledge, as well as in active involvement on the issues in interest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An example of such deployment of an argument visualisation tool in an eParticipation project can be found in <a href="http://www.wave-project.eu">the WAVE Project</a>. <a href="http://www.wave-project.eu">WAVE</a> aims to improve the inclusiveness and transparency of EU decision making at the national and European level by using highly integrated, state-of-the-art argument visualisation techniques to make the impact of complex EU environmental legislation on climate change more accessible and easy to understand for citizens, special interest groups and decision makers alike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.wave-project.eu">WAVE</a> has deployed <a href="http://debategraph.org/">Debategraph</a> as an innovative argument visualisation platform, in a multi-lingual, cross border context. The project has launched 3 pilot websites in the <a href="http://www.jointhewave.org/">UK</a>, <a href="http://www.debatclimat.eu/">France</a> and <a href="http://www.wave-diskusijos.lt/">Lithuania</a> where the tool is being tested and where the citizens engage in stimulating discussions on the environmental issues relevant to their countries and local communities. Each pilot has its own portal and argument visualisation mans in the national language, making it possible for every citizen to actively engage in the discussions.</p>

<div>Therefore, eMPOWER is a very unique project, which in fact combines 3 domains: (1) eParticipation, (2) ePetitioning and (3) environment. But this is not the main reason why eMPOWER is so distinct.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Environmental issues have become one of the most important topics and problems in the last decade. In addition, the global environment will become the most significant global issue within this century. Consequently, the environment will, or rather already is, an important public policy matter. However, it is important at the same time to realize and introduce policy-making from a new participative and eParticipation approach. Policy-making have been undergoing slow but strong modifications from top-down to bottom-up policy-making scheme. Therefore, citizens are given various tools at their disposal to influence and propose new legislations, eMPOWER and its ePetitioning tool being one of them.</div>

The first phase gathered more than 300 users in the pilot countries: France, Lithuania and England.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal for all the partners is to create a community of users and debaters in charge of testing online the WAVE platform and its innovating tool: Debategraph. This forum will use ground breaking graphical techniques to enable everyone, regardless of their level of knowledge, to exchange views and debate on complex climate change issues.</p>
<p>The WAVE Project will end in January 2011, after which the European Commission will decide whether this tool is efficient among others and if it should be used more intensively.</p>
<p>Climate change is one of the most challenging and most serious phenomenons which we must face today. Therefore citizens, special interest groups and decision-makers are invited to mobilize and subscribe, free of charge, to the following websites:</p>

Therefore, the European Commission is currently co-funding two projects under its eParticipation Preparatory Action: <a href="www.europetition.eu" target="_blank">EuroPetition</a> (<a href="http://www.europetition.eu">www.europetition.eu</a>) and <a href="www.ep-empower.eu" target="_blank">eMPOWER</a> (<a href="http://www.ep-empower.eu">www.ep-empower.eu</a>). However, the main problem with creating pan-EU eParticipation services, such as ePetitioning systems, is interoperability between the different eID systems amongst the Member States. It is of great importance to develop a reliable method of identification for ePetition in a cross-border context such as in the EU. As simple online identification in which only a name and e-mail address are required, are not sufficient for an ePetitioning process responding to the requirements put forward by under the article of the Lisbon Treaty referring to petitioning the European Parliament (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:EN:PDF" target="_blank">Article 11 of the Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union as amended by the Lisbon Treaty</a>).</p>
<p>Although the EU is currently running various cross border eIDENTIFICATION (eID) trials, there is no pan-European framework yet. In fact, implementing such framework poses several issues of interoperability between eID systems put in place by the different Member States, such as the Belgian eID is not interoperable with the Austrian one. Therefore, the issue of interoperability between Member States is crucial to create efficient pan-EU identification process enabling the provision of EU-wide eParticipation services. Several pilots, such as the <a href="https://www.eid-stork.eu/" target="_blank">STORK project (Secure Identity Across Borders Linked</a>), are currently funded by the European Commission to solve this important issue and enable not only the provision of pan-EU services in the framework of the EC Service Directive and eGovernment, but also in regards to cross border eParticipation services, such as e-Petitionning. Such example shows how eGovernment developments are crucial for eParticipation processes and development.</p>

<p>The Pilot Websites of the Project have been launched in the UK, France and Lithuania on 16 October 2009, 13 November 2009, and 10 December 2009  respectively. They can be accessed by going to the following websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.debatclimat.eu" target="_blank">www.debatclimat.eu</a> (French Pilot)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jointhewave.org" target="_blank">www.jointhewave.org</a> (UK Pilot)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wave-diskusijos.lt " target="_blank">www.wave-diskusijos.lt </a>(Lithuanian Pilot)</p>
<p>The official launch of the first pilot (French Pilot) took place in Sophia Antipolis (France) in the form of Sophia Café which focused on the topic of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: How to Intensify the Efforts? The event was organised by the consortium partner Foundation Sophia Antipolis (<a href="www.sophia-antipolis.org" target="_blank">www.sophia-antipolis.org</a>). It was organised under the patronage of Pierre Laffitte, Honorary Senator and the President of the Foundation Sophia Antipolis.</p>
