				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inclusion of immigrants is vital for social cohesion and economic development.  To enable immigrants to feel part of a larger society it is necessary to ensure that they have proper possibilities to participate fully in the society. The Immigrant Inclusion by eParticipation &#8211; IIeP project: www.iiep-project.eu/(1.10.09 &#8211; 30.4.2012) focused on obstacles on the way of participation and public engagement for people from various language and cultural backgrounds that reside in Estonia, Finland and Sweden, and solutions to overcome these using web-based social and communication tools.</p>
<p>The two manuals: &#8220;E-inclusion guidelines: supporting diversity&#8221; and &#8220;E-Participation guidelines: supporting diversity&#8221;, published in English, Estonian, Finnish and Swedish are the main outcomes from the IIeP &#8211; EU/Central Baltic INTERREG IVA project. These outputs found online and in pdf-versions on the new website: www.supportingdiversity.eu are aimed to meet the needs for those involved in participatory processes and immigrant involved issues. They also provide ideas and best practices for authorities to facilitate inclusion. The manuals can be used widely to support residents´ active participation in local multinational communities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstracts</strong></p>
<p>Andoni Alonso<br />
Abstract: The notion of Web 2.0 brings many different issues that should be discussed. One of the most interesting is how these electronic social networks can generate an added value in terms of content and shared knowledge. The question is to show how diasporans are also generating such content and how it can be privatized through companies such as FaceBook. Starting point would be to consider how all that on-line knowledge can be treated as a commons, because it is put on line, shared and improved by particulars. So diasporans can be deprived from their physical as well as their electronic homeland.</p>
<p>Randi Marselis<br />
Abstract: Social media on the internet have potential to strengthen transnational belongings amongst ethnic minority groups. However, young people of minority background often prefer to set up websites in the language of their country of settlement. This presentation focuses on journalistic Web-magazines run by Dutch Moluccan and Danish Kurdish youths. In what way do such Web-magazines give room for the cultural memory of migration? And how do belongings to a transnational community intersect with social and political engagement in the country of settlement?</p>
<p>Keywords: Websites, cultural memory, transnationalism, Dutch Moluccan youth, Danish Kurdish youth</p>
<p>Nico Carpentier<br />
Abstract: New media discourses are often engulfed by a variety of claims that emphasize their specificity. We can find the formulation of strong claims of novelty and uniqueness, in combination with processes of forgetfulness in relation to the societal roles of old media technologies. This presentation starts with a discussion on (new) audience theory, mapping and structuring the diversity of audience articulations with a focus on two of its main dimensions: the active/passive and the interaction/participation dimension. This mapping will then be used to problematize and critique the strong claims of novelty and uniqueness that ’new’ participatory technologies have generated. Moreover, this theoretical mapping will also show that audience theory turns out to be quite stable in its capacity to facilitate the understanding of the diversity of relations between humans and media technology. Three claims are scrutinized: the shift from one-to-many to many-to-many communication; the rearticulation of the audience into the ‘producer’; and the convergence of top-down business with bottom-up production and consumption practices. Each of these claims is critically evaluated, in combination with a case study discussion that shows the complexities and contradictions of these claims. These three case studies are the BBC’s Video Nation project in the UK, a reception study of nine films on the Belgian online video-sharing platform 16plus, and formal participatory (alternative and community media) organizations.</p>
<p>Edward Andersson<br />
Abstract: This workshop will look at the practice of e-participation with a particular focus on achieving long term engagement. It will draw on practical examples from numerous countries as well as a two and a half year research project exploring the individual motivations for participation in three sites in England.<br />
Different approaches and rationales for participation will be explored, as well as differences between online engagement and face to face engagement. Some engaging approaches (both online and face to face) will be demonstrated; allowing participant interaction.</p>
