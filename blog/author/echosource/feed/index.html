				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong> <!--[endif]--></strong></span><span lang="EN-GB">As the European Citizens Initiative (ECI) has now come to the phase of its final shaping, we now have the chance to contribute to its success in being a tool for true citizens participation in European politics. However, current discussions on the regulations drafted by the Commission do show some confusion about what this legislative instrument actually can provide and which risks it contains. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Generally ECI is understood as an instrument for decision-making or voting, as we know it from direct democratic instruments like referenda. Thus, the main use of ICT for the ECI is seen in the authentication and collection of votes (e-voting).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in fact ECI is not essentially a means for decision-making. Its legal consequences are limited to submission of proposals to the Commission, which in turn is not even obligated to pass this proposal to the parliament. Thus, ECI does only allow citizens to participate in political agenda setting and rather has to be understood as a process of collective opinion formation. Accordingly, current discussions on authentication and representativeness miss to address the crucial questions at stake, because ECI is not comparable to an election or referendum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However, this does not mean that ECI is not worth anything. As an instrument for participatory agenda setting, ECI does offer citizens an opportunity to deliberate on questions, which they feel concerned about and to proactively bring them on the political agenda. ECI could open a space for trans-cultural, trans-border discourse embracing all the different viewpoints Europeans from various member states may have, and thus, has the potential to establish a European public sphere. It is about creating a process of discursive appropriation of Europe by its citizens, making them co-authors of the European endeavour. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus, ECI must be understood much more as a participatory process, requiring an intelligent and consistent combination of offline and online methods for constructive collaboration at local, national and European level. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Furthermore, to prevent ECI from being misunderstood as a mere oppositional instruments, it will be equally important to guarantee a synergic interplay between civil organizations and governmental institutions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, further concretion and development of ECI must focus much more on the participative process of collective opinion formation and deliberative agenda setting. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Accordingly, the role of ICT in these processes has to be reconsidered. We will not only need e-voting systems and virtual IDs, but also powerful tools for cross-language dialogue, structured debate, collective co-creation of proposals and position papers as well as tools for effective e-campaigning and proactive self-organization.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea of creating a <em>global agora</em> through the use of ICT is at least as old as the Internet itself [1]. However, it took thirty years after the birth of this vision in the early 1970s to establish a broadly used global interactive medium. This development has been brought by the new wave of Web2.0 applications in the recent years. Interfaces became more dynamic and easier to use, user-generated multimedia content became common and internet-access spread throughout the world. However, a closer look at the tools of today´s social media reveals a lack of essential functional development. We still communicate mainly through E-mail and discuss in forums – both technologies dating back to the very beginning of the Internet. Even chats and wikis have not changed substantially since the last ten years. As a matter of fact, there are no tools at all, which could enable a truly solution-oriented, democratic mass collaboration.</p>
<p>In this sense, what we call Web2.0 is the process of socio-cultural adoption and re-appropriation of interactive tools, which are actually quite old – and this socio-cultural appropriation has been driven by civil society, <em>not</em> by governments.</p>
<p>It is not just that we are far from having reached the maximum of technological possibilities in creating effective tools for eParticipation – most of the tools eParticipation is using were not even made with this purpose. Thus, the fact, that civil society uses social media much more efficiently than governments do, is not very surprising. Neither is the fact that today´s eParticipation projects suffer from a negative correlation between the number of participants and their chance to actively participate.</p>
<p><em>„The greater the number of people targeted in an eParticipation initiative, the more general this initiative usually is, employing one-way communication. On the other hand, the fewer the people targeted in an eParticipation initiative, the more specific this initiative may be, allowing more active participation and more specific outcomes. [...] Hence, if eParticipation is visualised as a means for involving the millions of European citizens with the aim to jointly shape policies and influence decision-making, then current reality shows that Europe today is far away from this target“ [2].</em></p>
<p>Clearly, we did not achieve to develop tools for large-scale democratic collaboration. Instead we keep on using forums for discussions (which do not provide any structured results) and try to co-create texts in wikis (which do not provide any democratic process for content control - e.g. Wikipedia did work quite well as an encyclopaedia. But it uses a meritocratic, and thus undemocratic regime for content control, which is actually the reason for its current problems). Both tools are <em>not scalable</em>, and therefore not apt for constructive mass-collaboration.</p>
<p>To cope with this democratic deficit and the limitations of these tools, most of the more successful eParticipation projects employ moderated forums intensively. This model works quite well for eConsultations in limited regional scales like cities. However, it is not applicable for large-scale participation. Furthermore moderation is expensive and therefore limited to a certain period of time. In practice this means, that in the very moment a citizens is confronted with a certain problem, normally there is still no platform where she could discuss her own concerns or participate in related decisions. As a result, motivation to participate is limited to the few citizens who accidentally are interested in one of the issues being dealt with during the consultation. But the great majority of the citizens will always be interested in other issues (mainly those that are relevant in their own everyday life) and thus not be motivated to participate. To make eParticipation apt for mass collaboration on the European level, an <em>open space for deliberation</em>, <em>debate and decision-making</em> has to be established, allowing citizens to come up with <em>their</em> problems and suggestions whenever <em>they</em> want. Therefore new tools have to be developed providing structured debate and co-editing for huge numbers of participants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the same time official eParticipation initiatives are widely ignored by the public, civil movements and organizations are using ICT quite efficiently, activating millions of people with their eCampaigns. Thus, to achieve mass collaboration, successive civil movements, organisations and campaigns have to be taken into account and integrated into eParticipation initiatives [3]. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>“What will be necessary instead is an intelligent combination and interweaving of top-down and bottom-up models, joined together, further enhanced, and populated with the online personae of real people at the middle ground of online social interaction” [1].</em></span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Last year US-President Barack Obama showed us how Web2.0 can be used effectively to involve civil society. But the current protests against his government also show us what happens, if this active involvement is not converted into an ongoing process of political participation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Civil engagement is out there in abundance. However, to become a remedy for the actual crisis of democracy, eParticipation needs to pick up active citizens from where they are. Furthermore it has to give them prospects for true participation in political decision-making – that is, it must really <em>empower </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">people. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the bottom-up <em>noopolitics</em></span><span lang="EN-GB"> [4] of non-government civil engagement mainly act in opposition to the top-down <em>hard power</em></span><span lang="EN-GB"> of official government [1], [5]. The attempt to involve grass-root civil engagement into policy making is therefore bound to the integration of two different power-models. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>„More generally eParticipation tools can bridge between actor-driven and system-oriented modes of participation (as demonstrated empirically by Monnoyer-Smith, 2006)“ [6].</em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span id="more-2328"></span>In order to reach active citizens and make them participate, eParticipation must <em>bridge the gap </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">between civil society and government. Since most non-governmental movements and organizations mainly focus on protest actions through eCampaigning and ePetitioning, this means that protest must be converted into a truly <em>constructive debate </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">and <em>civil engagement</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Virtual Islands</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A further problem results from the fact, that the European public sphere is composed of different <em>social </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">and <em>cultural enclaves </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">that need to be included. From a top-down perspective, this carries the risk of group polarisation. But this risk is “arguably outweighed by its importance as a means of preserving a repertoire of alternative development paths essential for the long-term ability of social systems to adapt to changing circumstances” [6]. These enclaves are also reproduced within the virtual space of the Internet. Despite its overall interconnectivity, the Internet is composed of a vast amount of separated sites and platforms, each being islands populated by its own societal enclave. Thus, integrating grass-root engagement and official eParticipation is not just about connecting two poles – it is about constructing three-dimensional networks throughout societies, cultures and their hierarchical strata. In more technical terms this means, that eParticipation must take place not only on governmental portals, but also on NGO-websites, civil action platforms and simple blogs. Furthermore, eParticipation should not only be about discussing, drafting and voting, but rather about putting <em>proactive engagement </em></span><span lang="EN-GB">into the centre of public interaction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To overcome the low participation levels of existing eParticipation projects, eParticipation must be redefined as <em>active citizenship</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">. To motivate citizens for active participation, bottom-up initiatives conducted by civil movements and organizations must be interwoven with top-down approaches. <span> </span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">eParticipation is often equalized with “digital democracy”. Top-down approaches are based on the assumption that participation means involving citizens in governmental power structures. As governmental power builds on the development and execution of policies, it has been tried to make citizens participate in policy making. This led to the idea of a direct digital democracy, where virtually every law could be drafted and decided on by the citizens themselves. However, this vision of open virtual parliament or digital democracy faces several serious difficulties. Firstly, because of the lack of technical solutions for scalable discussion &amp; co-editing, collective drafting is not possible with existing online tools. Thus, there is still plenty of space for new innovations in this field to overcome such technical constrains. More importantly, such a participatory digital democracy would be characterized by single-issue decisions. This certainly can be seen as one of its greatest advantages. But if open drafting would generally result in binding laws, its democratic legitimation would have to be guaranteed. Thus, citizens would have to participate in virtually every running decision at local, regional, national and European level at the same time. Since this is absolutely impossible, decisions would be made by random sets of participants (probably mainly lobbyists) without any democratic legitimation. Clearly, eParticipation cannot and should not be understood as an alternative for existing representative democracy, but rather as a <em>complementary</em></span><span lang="EN-GB"> instrument.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To solve this dilemma, today´s eParticipation initiatives do not allow citizens to make binding decisions. Instead they ask people to contribute their ideas and preferences to preparatory stages of official decision-making processes. The binding decisions are still made by the institutions and their traditional decision-makers. In fact, eParticipation today is limited to eConsultations. It neither really empowers citizens, nor does it take into account their very own issues and concerns. As a result, the motivation for participation is very limited.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Instead of having been empowered, many participants may feel somehow betrayed or used to legitimate official decisions. From this perspective, eParticipation might be more interesting for decision-makers than for most citizens, who mainly look at politics as something quite boring and frustrating, which they do not feel very attracted to.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Today humanity is facing an enormous multi-crisis dilemma – creating an ever-growing complexity of interrelated local, regional and global problem-patterns. Political decision-makers have a hard job finding appropriate solutions and depend more and more on scientific advice [1]. Leading advisers Martin Lees (Secretary General of the <em>Club of Rome</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">) and Karl-Henrik Robèrt (Founder of the <em>Natural Step</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">) have recently pointed out (in a personal conversation), that this incapability to come up with appropriate solutions has got systemic roots. Our institutions are built to cope with single issues within limited regional scopes, thus they are not apt to deal with such multi-crises-dilemma. Therefore, the generation and collection of information, its conversion into institutional knowledge and its use in decision-making processes have been recognized as crucial tasks [2].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From this point of view, our current multi-crisis-dilemma can be understood as a general crisis of today´s democracies, basically caused by its over-complexity and the lack of appropriate knowledge management systems based on the <em>integration of collective knowledge</em></span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is now widely accepted, that only multi-stakeholder-inclusion can support our institutions with the necessary knowledge to face our challenges at stake. This requires a more networked approach of governance and a knowledge management based on public spaces for policy deliberation [3], [4].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But although the resulting frustration in the European population is manifested in decreasing voter turnouts on the one hand, and the use of ICT for eCampaigning and proactive action planning increases on the other hand, most eParticipation projects show quite a low citizen participation [5]. To understand this paradox it would be important to have a closer look at the technical tools and socio-political concepts being used in today&#8217;s eParticipation. </span><span></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivation and image

Global challenges such as the climate change and the economical crisis do increasingly worry the society. However, satisfying solutions to these challenges are not in sight. More and more people are dissatisfied with the political decisions of the representatives they have elected. One reason for that is the fact that most citizens do not understand the backgrounds and complex correlations of political and economical decisions and feel excluded from the decision-making processes. As a result, citizens are disenchanted with politics and lack civic commitment. In addition, existing possibilities regarding the participation in society and politics are not powerful and influential enough. Particularly young people increasingly lose their belief in democracy and fall into resignation.

These are the reasons for founding echo: echo is a platform for sustainable change and active civic participation and creates a basis for a democracy which is independent from political parties and in which people may participate at a local, regional, and global level. Citizens, experts, politicians, and decision makers in economy and society may discuss their points of view, mobilize fellow campaigners, plan activities together, and put them into practise. echo’s cross-platform approach overcomes the limits of particular portals and initiatives and therefore increases the power of their influence. echo builds on existing legislative instruments and therefore enables civic commitment to convert into true political participation.

echo acts as a social business and is committed to the basic ethical values of democracy as well as to the values of environmentally and socially sustainable economic management. Within the scope of its ‘your profit’ business philosophy, surpluses which are generated in the course of financing echo’s economic viability flow back into projects and ventures of the society. In this way, echo is a sample of a new business culture. When used in companies, its innovative social software directly contributes to strengthening a social and sustainable management style and to democratising existing business and economical structures. echo becomes a multiplier for sustainable ventures and a catalyst of democratic economic activities.

An interdisciplinary team of young and experienced academics forms the background of echo. These people are trained in the technological as well as in the socio-cultural and the economical field. A growing network of organisations, experts, as well as renowned intercessors increasingly supports this core team.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: normal">As we now have been PEP-NET member for about two months, we now finally would like to introduce echo to the ones who may not knows us yet &#8211; better late than never <img src="http://pep-net.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </span></p>
<h2>Motivation and image</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <strong>powerlessness</strong> and <strong>political resignation</strong> among the population and weakens people&#8217;s faith in democracy. Calls for <strong>transparency</strong> and more <strong>participation</strong> are growing louder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">The current crises can thus be understood as a general <strong>crisis of democracy. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 13.3333px">New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop <strong>constructive solutions</strong> to effectively tackle our “glocal” challenges. This is why echo has been founded: As a platform for sustainable change and <strong>active citizen participation</strong> echo enables a new form of non-partisan participatory democracy on local, regional and global level. With echo the first web-application is being developed to enable <strong>collective intelligence </strong>through democratic discourse even with a virtually unlimited number of participants.</span></span></p>
<p>echo offers a quick overview of  interesting discussions, gives people an opportunity to voice their opinions in a deliberative discourse and to jointly find the right solutions. On echo, people can connect with allies, experts and decision makers and together turn their decision into reality.</p>
<p>echo consists of three clearly separated functional areas, which at the same time are tightly interwoven:</p>
<h2><strong>Discuss, Connect, Act!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Discuss </strong><span>is the core area, which contains most unique features and enables </span><strong>collective intelligence</strong><span> to emerge. The discussions taking place in the discussion area offer a differentiated</span><strong> overview</strong><span> of the different statements edited and supported by certain regions or societal groups.</span></p>
<p>Every statement is edited through a self organized democratic process (without the need of moderators or admins). Thanks to the new <strong>semantic cross-language search engine</strong>, users can find easily a comprehensive selection of relevant information. With only minimal effort thousands of users can contribute to the dynamic evolution of sound statements.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> offers users an easy possibility to organizes their contacts, add interesting experts and opinion leaders their personal network and to connect people with <strong>specific competences</strong> relevant to a certain subject. To enhance usability and foster a viral growth there will be interfaces connecting several external social networks like twitter and facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Act!</strong><span> motivates the participants of discussions to proactively launch actions and projects, to jointly turn their ideas and visions into reality, and thus, make change visible in every day life. To do so, echo offers a virtual work space equipped with the necessary tools and information to efficiently plan and accomplish different kinds of actions and projects and found eco-socially sustainable businesses. </span></p>
<p>As most actions and projects will need funding, echo is based on powerful business models. &#8220;Powerful“ does not merely mean working cost-covering. It also means helping users to provide their actions with the necessary funds. This <strong>enables people to accomplish their goals</strong> and lets their virtual engagement influence our real world in a positive way, which is the key to <strong>motivate ever more people </strong>to participate on echo. Thus, the comprehensive concept of echo has true potential to free people from their sense of powerlessness, offer them a way of <strong>successful self-determination</strong> and help them restore their <strong>faith in democracy</strong>.</p>
<h2>Create Synergies</h2>
<p>In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a <strong>distributed approach</strong> and makes its functionality available throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog. In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and creates <strong>true synergies</strong>, instead of hamstringing competition.</p>
<h4>Shared User- and Opinion Base</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333px">Through cooperation with echo, partner platforms connect their communities with each other. This way, their different user groups are joint together in a single cross-platform community. The users can now connect throughout all platforms, discuss and jointly launch actions and projects.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, echo addresses to users on a larger scale exceeding such groups from existing platforms through an extended network with further organizations. This in turn, multiplies the range and influence of each single partner platform. Projects and campaigns profit from the viral dissemination and its huge and highly motivated community.</p>
<p>Discussions on issues, which are relevant to the different partner platforms can be initiated on any other partner platform, thus, enriching discussions and making them more interesting and alive. This way a much <strong>broader opinion base</strong> is formed, as possibly could emerge on any single platform.  New impulses and issues flow back and forth, enriching discussions and <strong>rising the attractiveness of all partner platforms.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">This thematic diversity – covering different thematic fields and ranging broadly and deeply into society – rises virality enormously. The synergetic effects allow for a common development of content throughout different communities, which offers interesting information to virtually every Internet user. Thus, the influence of the proposals elaborated in this distributed system will boost its influence on society enormously.</span></strong></p>
