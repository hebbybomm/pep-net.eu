Read the short summary of the report on Pep-Net.eu:</p>
<p>The implementation of e-voting for the elections to the Austrian Federation of  students was one of the  most sophisticated e-government projects in 2009. It&#8217;s aim was to  complement the paper based voting with an electronic voting channel. Together with the  implementation of e-voting the legal basis was adapted to include an  electronic election administration.</p>
<p>This first of a kind implementation of e-voting in Austria was  technically successful. Almost 1% (2.161) of the eligible students cast  their votes electronically between 18th and 22nd of May 2009. For  identification and authentication, they used the citizen card (the  Austrian model of a smart card with digital signature) and a suitable  smartcard-reader device, which was handed out for free. The anonymity  was performed by using a cryptographic protocol in the post-electoral  phase, similar to a paper based postal voting procedure. The e-voting  servers were placed in two data centers of the Federal Computing Centre to allow for fail-safe operation.</p>
<p>The use of the citizen card was appropriate because of its associated  high safety and powerful legal standing. However the penetration of the  citizen card is rather low at present. Therefore, the federal ministry  of science and research started the initiative studi.gv.at with the  purpose to raise awareness and penetration of the citizen card amongst  students. While over 14.000 students made use of this opportunity, only a  small portion of them used e-voting. Main reason to this is the general  limited number of applications aimed at students which make use of this  card. The general acceptance and with it the penetration numbers for  this smart card will only be reached when a wide range and a large  number of additional services are provided with appropriate  functionality, especially for students.</p>
<p>The discussion around e-voting was rather controversial with clear pro  and contra positions. On the one side the federal ministry of science  and research and on the other side selected representatives of the  federation of students. The discussion dominated the electoral campaigns  and hurt the institution of the elections.</p>
<p>For future uses of e-voting in Austria the penetration of identification  and authentication means has to be raised as well as a more positive  atmosphere amongst the stakeholders has to be reached.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier I have written about the Student Union <a title="Student Union Elections" href="https://oeh-wahl.gv.at/Content.Node/33092_3.php" target="_self">elections </a>of May 2009 which were Austria&#8217;s first use of a legally binding electronic voting system.</p>
<p>The <strong>E-Voting system required</strong> the students to authenticate themselves using a citizen card. In Austria this &#8220;citizen card function&#8221; is included in the social security card, which is called <a title="e-card" href="http://www.chipkarte.at" target="_self">e-card</a>. The e-card was launched in March 2005 in order to modernize the old fashioned system of legitimizing the citizen&#8217;s status in front of doctors via the paper version of the &#8220;Krankenschein&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <strong>e-card</strong> has since then been issued 8.5 million times according to the official website. 11.151 partners accept the e-card in doctor&#8217;s practices all over Austria and it has been used 405 million times for this purpose. But the e-card is much more than a tool for more efficient social security administration.<span id="more-530"></span> It can be activated and hence provide citizen card function for its holder. The benefit of this is to ensure secure web access to online banking, to file one&#8217;s income tax statement online, to request a character reference and many more. You could buy a car using the activated e-card, a card reader and your PINs.</p>
<p>Although this system itself is quite well established, security is granted and the usability is good, the citizen card function wasn&#8217;t as distributed and commonly used as it could have been. One of the main reasons for this is, that the real killer application is still missing. The second reason could be the absence of proactive campaigns to distribute the cards and the necessary card reader and to communicate this benefit to the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>In the fore field</strong> of the mentioned E-Voting project, a campaign, named <a title="studi.gv.at" href="http://www.studi.gv.at" target="_self">studi.gv.at,</a> has been started. It was aiming at building up some of the necessary infrastructure. Especially the second objection of lacking campaigns has now been debilitated. The studi.gv.at-campaign really arose awareness for E-Voting and the citizen card amongst the Austrian students. More than 11.500 citizen cards and free card readers have been distributed (before this campaign only about 15.000 citizen cards on the new version of the e-card have been activated throughout Austria).</p>
<p>How was this achieved?</p>
<p><strong>The concept</strong> was simple but effective. The campaign focused on active students to ensure word of mouth to colleagues. For this reason countless info stands were arranged in the universities&#8217; assemblies, the dates were printed on large posters. Student union functionaries were used as multipliers. The appearance focused on the time-saving aspect, social participation and being an early adopter. Scientific expertise has been provided to communicate credibility and trustworthiness. Another key strategy was to use the network of the involved players to further encourage the campaign. 30 Tutors were selected and trained with the ability to educate students so they could activate citizen cards by themselves for friends, colleagues or family members.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> for studi.gv.at was facilitated by the website, a regular newsletter, banners on partner websites and press releases at predefined milestone events. A raffle was also organized giving away trendy i-pods to the lucky winners. Forum threads and &#8220;advertorials&#8221; on universities&#8217; media rounded the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Another lesson learned</strong> is the fact, that the numbers of activated e-cards were steadily increasing, but only by relatively and equally small amounts for the first five months of the campaign. From October 2008 until February 2009 &#8220;only&#8221; 4.800 citicen cards were activated. The rest of the 6.700 cards have been activated in the last three moonths, which is astonishing!<br />
This was achieved by various factors. First of all by the tremendous effort of the engaged promotion partners, which would elsehow wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Second by the medial awareness created and gained by the emotional discussion around E-Voting in Austria. And thirdly by the fact, that such campaigns seem to need some time to build up momentum. People take a while until they get interested, until they care for something new. Getting attention is hard in the beginning, but if you dive through the hard time, it really pays.</p>
<p>All in all the <a title="studi.gv.at" href="http://www.studi.gv.at" target="_self">studi.gv.at</a> campaign is a real success story almost doubling the number activated citizen cards in Austria within months with manageable cost and reasonable effort. It truly boosted Austria&#8217;s &#8220;e-Governability&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="AÖWB" href="http://www.weltbund.at" target="_self">Austrian Expatriate World Council</a> was founded in 1952 aiming to coordinate the various existing associations of Austrian citizens living abroad. Its primary function is to represent its members in front of the Austrian federal government, public authorities, political parties and relevant departments in the economic and cultural field. It is governing body of over 170 associations and has several thousand members.</p>
<p>The organization has now again, as in previous years, made an effort to research its members&#8217; needs. From the beginning of March until April 20th an anonymous online <a title="Survey info" href="http://www.bmeia.gv.at/botschaft/auslandsoesterreicher/auslandsoesterreicher-innen/aoe-umfrage.html" target="_self">survey </a>has been conducted to find a better understanding for these needs and to communicate them to the <a title="BMAA" href="http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/foreign-ministry.html" target="_self">Austrian Foreign Ministry</a>.</p>
<p>The Austrian Federal Computing Centre (<a title="BRZ" href="http://www.brz.gv.at/Portal.Node/brz/public?gentics.pa=r&amp;gentics.pb=&amp;p.action=onFocus&amp;p.pboxid=PCN" target="_self">BRZ</a>) was in charge of designing, setting up and implementing the online platform. The survey consisted of ten themes related to which e-Government and e-Participation services expats want from Austria. Three of them were to be picked as a choice, an own suggestion could also be added. The answers were weighted, points were given according to the relative importance. The themes were:<br />
<span id="more-523"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Citizenship related issues</li>
<li>Employment Services</li>
<li>Education in Austria, specially for youth</li>
<li>Institutionalized representation of expatriates in the Austrian parliament</li>
<li>General information about Austria</li>
<li>Heritage related questions</li>
<li>Participation in elections</li>
<li>Pension related questions</li>
<li>Returning to Austria</li>
<li>Social- and insurance related questions</li>
</ul>
<p>2.779 citizens have participated, 350 have added own suggestions and 1.245 have requested to keep informed via email about further polls.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome was quite clear:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Citizenship related</strong> issues was the most important topic with 3.002 points, closely followed by<br />
<strong>Pension related questions</strong> with 2.961 points and on the astonishing 3rd place is the need for<br />
<strong>participation in national elections</strong> with 2.538 points. This third issue is in particular interesting as it shows, that expats are interested on politics in their home country and they wish to actively participate, which seems to contrast the situation created by poor voter turnout in Austrian elections. Since the introduction of postal voting in 2007 this is already a possibility.</p>
<p>The following three priorities were quite a bit behind the first. Returning to Austria with 1.632, Social- and insurance related questions with 1.619 and General information about Austria with 1.552 points.</p>
<p>Finally there was a cluster of the trailing four issues Heritage related questions with 967 points, Education in Austria, 843 points, Institutionalized representation with 831 and finally Employment Services with only 729.</p>
<p>Of the 350 people who have added their own thoughts it was remarkable that the most mentioned was the will to recieve Austrian television (not because it&#8217;s so bad!), culture, questions of taxes and legal issues and many others, which I&#8217;ll not name here in detail. Should you be interested in further information you cna dpwnload a pdf <a title="outcome" href="http://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/bmeia/media/AOes/AOe-Umfrage/AOE-Prioritaeten-Umfrage__Ergebnisse_iv.09.pdf" target="_self">here</a> (in german).</p>
<p>The final findings will be published in more detail during a conference in the beginning of September of this year.</p>

The Austrian Federal Student Union is being elected starting today morning and running until Friday via a remote electronic channel. Next week from Tuesday the 26th until Thursday the 28th of May an ordinary, paper based voting channel will be opened to ensure.</p>
<p>The paper and the electronic votes will be counted on the 28th and hence the result should be available  around Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The voting system was programmed by the Spanish E-Voting specialist <a title="Scytl S.A." href="http://www.scytl.com" target="_self">Scytl </a>and is hosted at the Austrian Federal Computation <a title="BRZ" href="http://www.brz.gv.at/Portal.Node/brz/public?gentics.am=PCP&amp;p.contentid=10007.17664" target="_self">Center</a>. The Austrian <a title="BMWF" href="http://www.bmwf.gv.at/submenue/english/" target="_self">Ministry </a>of Science and Research is the initiator, Robert <a title="E-VotingCC Krimmer" href="http://www.e-voting.cc/topics/Team/" target="_self">Krimmer</a> from E-Voting.CC is consulting the implementation process.</p>
<p>The going online of the voting system this morning went as planned. A minor problem although occurred with the Intranet connection at the BRZ but this was quickly solved and did in no way affect the voting system itself.</p>
<p>We are glad and also a bit proud, that this project is now successfully in the &#8220;delivery phase&#8221;, we hope everything will keep running smoothly!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally our newest project has been released and delivered to our readers: The biannual free special <a title="Magazine" href="http://www.e-voting.cc/static/evoting/files/ModernDemocracy_2009_01.pdf" target="_self"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-422" src="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/moderndemocracy_2009_01-15-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>interest <a title="Magazine" href="http://www.e-voting.cc/static/evoting/files/ModernDemocracy_2009_01.pdf" target="_self">magazine </a>&#8220;Modern Democracy&#8221; by <a title="E-Voting.CC" href="http://www.e-voting.cc/" target="_self">E-Voting.CC</a>.<br />
As I have announced in an earlier <a title="Modern Democracy announcement" href="http://pep-net.eu/wordpress/?p=293" target="_self">entry</a> we issued the first edition of our magazine dealing with selected topics in the field of E-Democracy and it&#8217;s newest developments. The magazine is distributed all around the world.<br />
Before I give you a quick overview of the contents, I want to thank all of you who have mailed us the registration coupons. The responses were overwhelmingly positive and gave us the affirmation that such a magazine is needed and wanted. Thank you for all the positive feedback!</p>
<p>The first article deals with the upcoming student union elections in Austria. This event will mark the entry of Austria into the list of countries with legally binding electronic elections. Students will be able to cast their vote via Internet from May 18th until May 22nd &#8211; one week before the paper election. The results will be counted after the last polling stations are closed.<br />
The intention behind this project is to give every student an easy and uncomplicated way of participating in these biannual elections and to innovate the Austrian voting procedures.</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span>The magazine also features an article dealing with a deeper insight into the results of the CAHDE working group of the <a title="CoE" href="http://www.coe.int/t/e/integrated_projects/democracy/02_activities/002_e-democracy/" target="_self">Council of Europe</a>. A roadmap shows the different stages of E-Democratic tools how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>My main contribution to the magazine was an email-interview with <a title="Matthew McGregor" href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/blog/entry/meet-bsd-questions-with-matthew-mcgregor/" target="_self">Matthew McGregor</a>. He works for <a title="BSD" href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/" target="_self">Blue State Digital</a>, a full service agency that offers integrated campaign design. By the way: I met Matthew on Dan Jellinek&#8217;s great <a title="e-Democracy08" href="http://www.headstar-events.com/edemocracy08/index.php" target="_self">e-Democracy08</a> conference in London, in November 2008.<br />
In the interview we ponder about what new forms of online campaigning can do for democracy or about which lessons European politicians can learn from Obama&#8217;s unprecedented Internet presence.</p>
<p>Other topics are conference reviews of 2008&#8242;s most important E-Democracy events and a schedule for 2009, a book review and a market survey of companies who are specialized in E-Voting technology.</p>
<p>If you are interested in obtaining our magazine, which will be issued twice a year, just send us an email with you name &amp; address to: <a href="mailto:modern-democracy@e-voting.cc">modern-democracy@e-voting.cc</a><br />
You can also <a title="Modern Democracy" href="http://www.moderndemocracy.cc/files/ModernDemocracy_2009_01/" target="_self">download </a>the latest issue from our website.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;d be glad to send you your copy for free and without any obligations!</strong></p>
