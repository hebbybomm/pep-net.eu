				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have just joined pep-net and are excited about working with other organsiations within the network.</p>
<p>Mi-Voice is an electronic voting and consultation tool which encourages people to participate in democratic events by allowing them to take part online or via a text message. Currently our products are mainly being used by local authorities for various types of community engagement however we are always branching out into new markets and currently have 2 universities using the Mi-Voice as well.</p>
<p>By joining the network we are hoping to keep abreast of eParticipation throughout Europe. We are also looking to expand Mi-Voice into Europe and are looking for organsiations based in Europe to work with.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me my email address is fcarrington@mi-voice.com</p>
