				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online petitioning is  one of the oldest forms of e-participation around &#8211; in Scotland&#8217;s case it has  been part of the political system for 10 years now. Partly to mark the 10 years  of operation, the Scottish Parliament on 16 June 2009 published <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/petitions/reports-09/pur09-03.htm" target="_blank">the report of a year-long inquiry by the Public Petitions  Committee</a> into the public petitions process, including its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Petitioner">e-Petitioner</a> system. This inquiry looked at how to  improve awareness of the existence of the public petitions process, particularly  amongst hard to reach groups; participation in the process itself; and the  scrutiny role fulfilled by the Committee. For practitioners, it gives an insight  into how a maturing e-participation technology is incorporated into the  political process.</p>
<p>There are a number of  interesting observations and recommendations: one highlight for me is the  emphasis on physically holding meetings around the country, involving community  workers, and also using former petitioners as ambassadors for the process.</p>
<p><strong>e-</strong>Petitions are treated as just another route to get your voice heard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;86. &#8230;it must be  recognised that technology is only an enabler of participation and therefore it  is not axiomatic that increased engagement will occur as a consequence of new  technology. ICTs should be used as a means of enhancing traditional methods of  engagement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://itc.napier.ac.uk/">ITC</a> was involved in the development of the e-Petitioner system in 1999, and I am now involved in the <a href="http://www.europetition.eu/" target="_blank">EuroPetition</a> project that carries many of the ideas forward).</p>
<p>The  petitions committee has  identified the need for a &#8220;coherent strategy&#8221; for the introduction of video,  blogging and other Web2.0 technologies by the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s petitions  committee, and set up a <a href="http://scottishparliamentpetitions.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">new blogspot blog</a> and produced a new petitions DVD. I believe this shows a real willingness to learn by the  politicians.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d  recommend taking 8 minutes to watch<a href="http://scottishparliamentpetitions.blogspot.com/2009/05/launch-of-public-petitions-committees.html" target="_blank"> the excellent video</a> (Windows Media format) on <a href="http://scottishparliamentpetitions.blogspot.com/2009/05/launch-of-public-petitions-committees.html">this blog entry</a>. It  explains how the petitioning process works from petitioners&#8217; and politicians&#8217;  viewpoints and has some nice stories about how this form of petitioning  increases engagement with politics.</p>
