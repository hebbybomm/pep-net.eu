				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Virtual walls are cropping up in place of visible walls&#8221; said Hillary Clinton, last January 21, in a very important speech on Internet freedom. We can see it every day in Iran, China, Viertnam, Burma and in many countries a spike in threats to the free flow of information. It also happening in Europe, in Belarus, where President Lukashenko has signed a decree regulating the dissemination of information on the, in the context of a tumultuous presidential election, next year.</p>
<p><span><span id="more-1754"></span>This Decree, which will come into force on next 1st of July, stipulates that all governmental institutions should place information on their activities only on official web-sites. Not only that, but, according to the decree, all information which is disseminated through &#8220;Belarusian Internet&#8221; must have hyperlinks to the source. State registration is introduced for all Internet providers in Belarus. The official procedure for registration will be announced in due time. &#8220;In order to provide security for the citizens of the country, Internet service providers are obliged to identify users Internet access devices, keep track of such devices and Internet services rendered&#8221;, &#8211; Belarusian president&#8217;s press-service states. </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>In this context of increasing number of examples of threats to free access to the Internet, the speech of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, is a good reminder of the importance of preserving this new right of peoples to free access to the information through ICT.</span></p>
<p><span>This speech summed up perfectly the vision of democracies facing the expansion of information networks that are now &#8220;a new nervous system for our planet.&#8221;</span> &#8220;Viral videos and blog posts are becoming the samizdat of our day&#8221;, she said, referring to the small pamphlets which circulated during the communist period in East Europe. Most important, she <span>highlighted a new freedom, &#8220;Freedom to connect&#8221; that must be considered as &#8220;equivalent to freedom of assembly&#8221;, convinced that &#8220;online organizing is a critical tool for advancing democracy&#8221;.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vinnova, the Swedish Governmenal Agency for Innovation Systems published &#8220;eGovernment of Tomorrow&#8221;. In this report, four scenarios are presented for eGovernment in 2020 with the main idea that in the future public participation will grow and trust in government and society will be important.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to read what can imagine the swedish agency: from the idea that &#8220;Government goes private&#8221; because a private actor emerges with efficiency to the idea of co-production with a strong participation in communities from Government, it is a new style of Government which emerge.</p>
<p>Can we imagine something like a new service &#8220;Google Government&#8221; in the future?<br />
Or an emerging &#8220;Big Brother society&#8221; where people felt that, on balance, improved services outweighed the risk to personal integrity?</p>

In these words, Daniel Roleff, editor of the German portal politik-digital has introduced e-Participation.net, during the last eDemocracy Awards workshop. It is a joint initiative of the German website and the British Council, the British cultural agency in Germany to create an interactive database on projects and initiatives aimed at strengthening citizen participation in Germany and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>If, today, the e-participation.it website identifies e-Democracy initiatives in Italy, the aim is to open this database to all European experiences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Independent but not neutral&#8221; is the self definition of Pollitika.com. Launched in 2006 by Marko Rakar, known for his political notes on his blog about the political situation of this south european country of 4.5 million inhabitants, Pollitika.com has become an inevitable website about politics. Three thousand bloggers are enrolled and contribute to the website. About 2.000 new articles are published every year for 150.000 visitors per month.</p>
<p>Mark Rakar is a passionate man. During the visit of the French National Assembly, proposed to the participants of the last World eDemocracy Forum, he enjoyed every moment and every picture. Curious by nature, quoting the American strategist Joe Trippi and convinced that an electoral campaign is &#8220;too serious matter to be left to political parties&#8221;, it was not a surprise that he is one of Top 10 Who Are Changing the World of Internet and Politics. During the eDemocracy Awards workshop, last october, he explained how Pollitika.com strengthened democracy in Croatie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caitlin Morrissey, PoliticsOnline.com editor, explains in this video how the web&#8217;s oldest political Internet company selects during the last ten years the &#8220;10 Who Are Changing the World of Internet and Politics&#8221;. This year, the International e-Democracy Award was given by Phil Noble, founder of PoliticsOnline, to Peter Greenberger, head of the Google division in charge of political advertising. <span style="font-size: 10pt" lang="EN-US">The online tools that Google offers (YouTube, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Ads) were heavily used over the course of the recent American presidential campaign. Democratic candidate Barack Obama spent 7.5 million dollars integrating these tools into his campaign strategy. Peter Greenberger informs and educates policy makers and administration officials regarding the use of these tools in order to make the political process more accessible to ordinary citizens.</span></p>
<p>According PoliticsOnline, Peter Greenberger and his team have played a key role in enhancing transparency and democracy in the United States, which significantly change the worldview of politics among citizens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World eDemocracy Forum is one of the main venues for key international e-Participation players. As founding member of PEP-Net, I would like to make this annual event a promotional event for our network. The election of Barack Obama at the White House has validated theories developed in the Forum since ten years on the impact of ICT on political life and civic participation. Time is coming for more concrete practice. We want now to bring to light those who daily work to build the digital society for citizens.</p>
<p>It is why our special guests are finalists of the e-Democracy Awards, selected by our partners (PoliticsOnline in US, Politech Institute in Europe, Blog Territorial in France). They are coming from USA, Egypt, Bolivia, Italy, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany or UK and each of them has a project, an idea, an application that transforms politics in their countries and beyond. We are very excited to learn more and more about new practices.</p>
<p>The World eDemocracy Forum is participating in the &#8220;Pep-Net Conference Series&#8221;, an initiative started by Pep-Net members, who are organizing conferences throughout the years 2009 and 2010. As a special programme there will be additional workshops lead by Pep-Net members and invited speakers. After <a href="http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/department/gpa/telematik/veranstaltungen/id/12990/index.php?URL=/en/department/gpa/telematik/edemconferences/12990" target="_blank">Vienna</a> (September) and <a href="http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/09/09/berlininoctober-2009-unconference/" target="_blank">Berlin</a> (October) and before <a href="http://www.headstar.com/site/scripts/events_info.php?eventID=32" target="_blank">London </a>(November), Issy (Paris) will be the next stop for PEP-Net members (October 22-23).</p>
<p>We organize a special visit in the French National Assembly.  A meeting with the chairman of the IT group in the National Assembly is specially organized for PEP-Net members on the following question: &#8220;Is it possible to transfer Obama&#8217;s net-campaign to Europe?&#8221;. It is a reference of the <a href="http://pep-net.eu/blog/2009/08/26/why-transferring-obamas-campaign-to-germany-does-not-work/">interesting note </a>published by Hans Hagedorn last August.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.edemocracy-forum.com/october-1617-2008-program.html" target="_blank">The World eDemocracy Forum Program</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.edemocracy-forum.com/registration-1.html" target="_blank">Registration</a> (Special rate for PEP-Net members)</p>
<p>Please note that Paris is a very attractive destination for tourism. It is sometime difficult to book a room close to the conference. Don&#8217;t wait for book your room in our partner: &#8220;<a href="http://www.oceaniahotels.com/en/oceania-hotels/fiche-hotel.php?h=20&amp;sa=rh&amp;st=v&amp;sf=13" target="_blank">Hotel Ocenia</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you in Paris !</p>
