				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to the UK election communication experts predicted an „<a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/977198/Comms-chiefs-predict-first-internet-election-UK/" target="_blank">internet election</a>“. In the aftermath of the election, varying conclusions on the effect of e-campaigning have been drawn. A review of opinions.</p>
<p><span id="more-2566"></span><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7113351.ece" target="_blank">Times: TV-debates were crucial<br />
</a>The voters had not even had the chance to make their vote when the Times delivered its verdict: The TV debates ruled the election campaigns. 140 characters on Twitter were not quite enough to be a key factor, states the Times. Hardly any politician had been able to capitalise on the possibilities offered by the internet. Nevertheless, something was different this time around, probably due to the web: Parties and politicians found it much more difficult to set the agenda. Instead they had to deal with the topics the people forced them to talk about, says the Times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/04/new-digital-battlefield-old-politics" target="_blank">Guardian: Parties missed their chances</a><br />
In the Guardian the digital strategist of Obama´s successful presidential campaign, Joe Rospars, expresses his believe that the parties have not been able to use the internet properly. They just changed the battlefield, not the tactics. Rospars points out that some independent organizations have shown how to do it. The initiative „<a href="http://action.hopenothate.org.uk/content/2010-elections" target="_blank">hope not hate</a>“ for instance sought to prevent candidates of the British National Party from winning seats in the parliament. They organized most events via the internet. An example: Several hundred volunteers handed out 100.000 protest newspapers in two suburbs of London. In both election districts the nationalists fell considerably short of winning a mandate. According to Rospars the secret of the initiative´s success was their skill to transport clear instructions in their messages – and not to lose itself in woolly words. In Rospars`opinion they showed the strong leadership the parties did not deliver.<br />
<a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/rospars-failure-britains-post-obama-internet-election" target="_blank"><br />
TechPresident: Not enough time?</a><br />
TechPresident´s Nancy Scola, in response to Rospar´s analysis, identiefies the short period of time left for the partys&#8217; electoral campaign as a key factor for unsuccessful e-campaigning. Wheras Obama had nearly two years to optimize his strategy, in Britain there was hardly one month left between the announcement of the election date and the polling day. Additionally, Scola assumes that Obama´s web-campaign perfectly matched his image, a fact that might have played a vital part in the campaign´s success.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/advertising-how-did-it-influence-this-election-1965692.html" target="_blank">Independent: Tweets of the day</a><br />
The Independent compares internet and television with the classic poster ad. The results of the web-campaigns may have been disappointing, but nevertheless they spiced up the controversies between the contestants. Furthermore, the newspaper collected the best tweets of the election day. A rather radical message was for instance posted by the journalist Alex Wood: „Remember, everytime someone votes for David Cameron, a puppy dies.“</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/05/so_was_it_an_internet_election.html" target="_blank">BBC: Web not ineffective at all</a><br />
The BBC´s Rory Cellan-Jones firmly believes that the internet played an important role ahead of the election day. Especially young voters got involved with politics thanks to the web. The tie between the election commission and facebook helped to raise the number of first-time voters registering to vote, says Cellan-Jones. And the parties used the web for internal communication and organisation: The extensive usage of e-mail made f2f-staff meetings dispensable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Lisbon Treaty is expected to enter into force on December 1st, 2009. Consequently the European Citizens’ Initiative will become reality. The European Commission is now asking its citizens for support: How should the idea be put into practice?</p>
<p><span id="more-1425"></span><br />
&#8220;It is vital for democracy that the citizens participate in decision making,&#8221; <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1696&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guiLanguage=en" target="_blank">said the European Commission Vice President, Margot Wallström</a>. Starting next year, the signatures of one million EU citizens will be sufficient to provide the Commission with issues to negotiate.</p>
<p>However, certain details have yet to be clarified: In how many different nations should the  signatures be collected? How can be determined whether the signatures are authentic? Should there be an opportunity to participate online in the citizens&#8217; initiatives?</p>
<p>A so-called Green-Book is supposed to push forward the concrete embodiment of the citizens&#8217; initiative. EU citizens have the opportunity to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/consultation_en.htm" target="_blank">send in their suggestions</a> and opinions via mail or e-mail until the end of January 2010.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European e-participation-scene gathered in <a title="http://berlininaugust.politik-digital.de" rel="nofollow" href="http://berlininaugust.politik-digital.de/" target="_blank">BerlinInAugust 2007</a> to identify future aspects of the growing field of e-democracy. 25 Participants from 13 countries discussed for two days in the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin (ehemaliges Staatsratsgebäude) what issues are emerging, discussed good and bad practices and tried to build up a network. The British Council Germany gave some funding for travel expenses. On July 17th and 18th 2008 there has been a follow up &#8211; <a title="http://berlininjuly.e-demokratie.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://berlininjuly.e-demokratie.org/" target="_blank">BerlinInJuly 2008</a> . Tom Steinberg, <a title="http://www.mysociety.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mysociety.org/" target="_blank">mySociety.org</a>, Politik Digital, <a title="http://www.politik-digital.de" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politik-digital.de/" target="_blank">politik-digital.de</a> and Christian Heise, <a title="http://www.e-politik.de" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.e-politik.de/" target="_blank">e-politik.de</a> / <a title="http://www.e-demokratie.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.e-demokratie.org/" target="_blank">e-demokratie.org</a> were bound to be the inviting group. The group of guests included some of the 2007 guests as well as some new people; important new networks in the field will be informed about the meeting. In total, there were about 40 international persons attending the unconference which was prepared, just as in the last year, through this wiki.</p>
<p>This year, on 15-16th October 2009, there will be another follow up: <a title="Berlin in October 2009" href="http://berlininoctober.e-demokratie.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">Berlin in October 2009</a>. Even though this Unconference is by invite only, we are still looking for suggestions of smart, interesting people to join. The only real criteria for attendees: the desire and the determination to get things built that actually help citizens, rather than just talking about how great it could be if someone else did it. If you feel that you would be matching this profile, please contact one of the organising institutions. There are still open slots. We especially welcome non-EU participants. Limited funding is available.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launched on initiative by individual PEP-NET members, a working group came up with a strategy for PEP-NET to be promoted on conferences in our field of expertise. The main results of the working group are as follows:</p>
<p>1)The aim of the initiative is to brand and promote the name and idea of PEP-NET as well as to acquire new members;<br />
2)Starting in September, PEP-NET will become an integral component of conferences organized by members of PEP-NET;<br />
3)Presentation and implementation of PEP-NET during the conferences should remain within the responsibility of the respective organizers. Though the working group agreed on four minimum features which should be common in all conferences:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>1.A PEP-NET workshop should be organized along a specific question; the question remains the same in all conferences, yet provokes hopefully very different results since the participants of the respective workshops have very different backgrounds (e.g. scientists, politicians, NGO-practitioners).</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>2.PEP-NET should always be presented in a short introduction, maybe also with the help of graphic displays (e.g. banner, stand-up displays, buttons).</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>3.The working group will design a leaflet, which contains information about upcoming conferences, a short whois and maybe contact details; the leaflet will be circulated among the PEP-NET members and should also be handed out to the participants of PEP-NET workshops.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>4.Each PEP-NET workshop should start with the findings of the previous workshop and try to complement the views.</li>
</ol>
<p>4) The results of PEP-NET workshops are thought to be summed up in a conference proceeding, which will be posted in a specific section on our web-log. A right-frame-teaser could possibly be created for the homepage.</p>
<p>The members of the working group are happy to receive your comments, feedback, ideas or support on this initiative. We encourage you also to communicate the new PEP-NET slots on conferences and to create awareness of our new initiative.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The „<a title="Bürgerforum Europa 2009" href="http://www.buergerforum2009.de/d/" target="_blank">Bürgerforum Europa</a>“, a web-based community launched on the initiative of the <a title="Bertelsmann Stiftung" href="http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xchg/bst" target="_blank">Bertelsmann Stiftung</a> in cooperation with the <a title="Heinz Nixdorf Stiftung" href="http://www.heinz-nixdorf-stiftung.de/" target="_blank">Heinz Nixdorf Stiftung</a>, assembles German citizens who care about Europe&#8217;s future. By publishing their resolution, the so-called „<a title="BürgerProgramm " href="http://www.buergerforum2009.de/site/downloads/BuergerProgramm_Europa_2009-05-07.pdf" target="_blank">BürgerProgramm</a>“, the community members direct their claims now to Brussels.<br />
<span id="more-458"></span><br />
Sixteen claims, grouped in eight categories, are meant to revive the debate on prospective EU issues. The scope of questions ranges considerably. The community is bringing up issues like introducing common European history books as well as the call for concerted economic and financial policies among member states.</p>
<p>What makes &#8220;Bürgerforum Europa&#8221; so special is the fact, that the members were chosen randomly by the initiators. The Bamberger Centrum für Empirische Studien (BACES) contacted citizens based on a particular pattern that includes age, region and different levels of education. 361 of them were finally admitted to take part in the project.</p>
<p>The Bürgerforum worked both offline and online. Now that the citizens&#8217; requests are put down to paper, a dialogue with German and European politicians is supposed to transport the ideas to Brussels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="votematch.eu" href="http://votematch.eu/" target="_blank">Votematch.eu</a> opens with a bold statement: “ Good ideas catch on“, implying that the new online platform, which compares positions of political parties in the European Parliament with one’s own, is indeed such a good idea. The project, which is organised in a joint effort by the <a title="Institute for political participation" href="http://www.politeia.net/Newsletter/politeia_newsletter_48_february_2008/Politeia-News/dutch_institute_for_political_participation" target="_blank">Institute for Political Participation (IPP)</a> in the Netherlands and the <a title="Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung" href="http://www.bpb.de" target="_blank">Federal Agency for Civic Education</a> (bpb) in Germany, was launched in June 2008. The educational tool is based on the original method of the Dutch StemWijzer, which reduces the complexity of political party positions to single-sentenced claims and compares one’s own preference with those given by the parties.<br />
Since its first launch, the StemWijzer-method has been copied in the run-up to numerous elections in different EU-member states. “Vote match Europe” now assembles 12 different “Vote Matchers” on one platform and offers thereby a Pan-European overview of the respective national political parties grouped in political factions in the EP. In contrast to the <a title="www.euprofiler.eu" href="http://www.euprofiler.eu/" target="_blank">EU-Profiler</a>, the answers to the theses are not generated from the parties’ programs, but individually given and authorized by the parties themselves. This certainly improves the authenticity of the project, yet does not erase the question marks which evolve if political party positions are reduced to one single sentence. After all, Vote Match is still a clickable infotainment tool, which establishes a bridge between young potential voters and the confusing jungle of daily party politics.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For those who haven&#8217;t decided yet on their favourite party for the elections in the European Union, 4-7 June 2009, a new interactive web feature, the <a title="www.euprofiler.eu/" href="http://www.euprofiler.eu/" target="_blank">EU-profiler</a>, helps to make up your mind. The tool promises support in discovering the political landscape for the upcoming elections in Europe. However, its functionality and clickability are not free of hitches.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-412"></span></p>
<p style="0cm;" lang="en-GB">The EU-profiler compiles around 30 political theses ranging from social and fiscal policies to questions concerning society, internal and external affairs. These theses are connected with the political viewpoints of numerous political parties from all 27 EU-member states. By answering to a random selection of the assumptions, the user positions himself within the political landscape. Additionally, he or she can indicate his or her affinity towards political themes and political parties, which gives further weight to particular answers or positions.</p>
<p style="0cm;" lang="en-GB">After the long clicking and ticking process, the EU-profiler is thought to provide an idea of the user&#8217;s individual political orientation and the respective match concerning a political party preference. Of course, the results compare more to an interpretation than a deep analysis. And it is obvious that a cross-country analysis can only bring approximate, no definitive results. However, the statistical and analytical steps leading towards the results as well as the interpretation of them bear some inconsistencies and provoke some question marks.</p>
<p style="0cm;" lang="en-GB">First of all, the selection of parties under examination appears to a certain extent randomly chosen. Next to the “common six” <em>–</em> meaning all six parties represented in the parliament of Germany (<em>Bundestag) – </em><span style="normal;">the EU-profiler examines also the Newropeans (a pan-european politcal movement), Free Voters (</span><em>Freie Wähler, </em><span style="normal;">a Bavaria based political registered association) as well as the two competing nationalist parties German People&#8217;s Union </span><em>(Deutsche Volksunion, DVU)</em><span style="normal;"> and The Republicans (</span><em>Die Republikaner, REP)</em><span style="normal;">. The 22 remaining parties, which are officially registered and admitted for the elections, find no reflection in the analytical comparison. This selection appears odd. Limiting the cases under examination is certainly a necessary step to keep the analysis manageable, but the selection criteria should follow a consistent pattern. The FAQ explains that “every significant party is featured in the EU Profiler“ meaning parties that „are polling to win seat this time around“. The latest polls, however, see none of the four smaller parties even close to win a single seat. </span></p>
<p style="0cm;" lang="en-GB"><span style="normal;">A second flaw in the analytical set-up is the fact, that some parties have only partly answered the list of theses, which were composed in an joint effort of seven European institutes under the lead of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies. Hence, theoretically, a 100 per cent match can be based on one single assumption, which both the party and the user have answered in the same way. Furthermore, some theses appear out of the context of the national environment in the run up to the elections. In our test-runs we were asked to express our opinion about the Greek health system, a theme which seems only loosely connected with the German electoral campaign for the elections in the European Union. This is not to deny that the EU-profiler represents a massive collection of data on the standpoints of political parties in all EU-member states. Also,the intention to provide an overview over the arguably largest political landscape in the world is very honourable.</span></p>
