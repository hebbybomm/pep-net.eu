				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span><span>Brussels, November 2010 &#8211;The Flemish Government and a host of European local government partner organisations have launched an open online consultation to encourage local eGovernment practitioners across Europe to help identify practical solutions to combat working barriers to eGovernment at the local level such as bureaucratic red tape, cultural resistance and divergent privacy and data protection laws.<span style="color: #0000ff"></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"></span></p>
<p>The objective of this effort is to produce a pan-European ‘Call to Action’ &#8211; known as <strong><span>The Citadel Statement</span></strong> – that will help local government deliver on the key objectives of the Malmo Ministerial Declaration by identifying the top things that national and EU decision makers can do by 2013 to better support local eGovernment. Initial research shows that despite numerous policy documents and ‘how to’ manuals on local eGovernment, nearly one year on the ‘Malmo Vision’ is still not being translated down to the on-the-ground, local level.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"></span></p>
<p><span><span>The online consultation will close on November 5.  Join in the consultation now and help ‘Make Malmo Real’ at the local government level: </span></span><strong><span><span lang="nl-be"><a title="blocked::http://egovstatement.wordpress.com/" href="http://egovstatement.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://egovstatement.wordpress.com</a></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Citadel Statement will be formally launched at the Belgian Presidency’s forthcoming ‘Lift Off Towards Open Government’ Conference on December 15-16.   The Flemish Government invite practitioners from across Europe to the site of the old Ghent Citadel on December 14 &#8211; the perfect place to launch an ‘Ideal Cities Statement,’</span></span></p>

The aim of  the project is to provide all citizens – regardless of their literacy skills or  subject matter knowledge – a unique platform/portal to learn about immigration  policy at the EU level and find out what particular policies mean to them on a  national level, so they can contribute to the drafting of a common EU  immigration policy. Equally important, Puzzled by Policy will help decision  makers at both the national and European level better understand the impact of  their policies on constituents by feeding citizen reactions back to them.  Further information about the project will be provided here  soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The OurSpace project, selected as one of the top proposals from the last ICT PSP call, has officially kicked off on the 23rd of July in Athens. The meeting was organised on the premises of NTUA by the project coordinator – the Athens Technology Centre – who will lead the OurSpace consortium for the next 3 years.</p>
<p>OurSpace plans to create a unique online collaboration space designed to actively engage young European citizens in the moulding of their future society. The platform will incorporate all the latest social media tools and applications and will be designed with help of the end-users themselves to ensure high attractiveness and usability of the platform.</p>
<p>The project success will not depend only on the technical delivery of the platform but mainly on the high participation rate of the end-users and OurSpace consortium has on board partners such as UK Youth Parliament, Café Babel Magazine or Google Ireland with links to millions of young people from Europe so we all hope that OurSpace will be a success story!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">We still have a long way to go before governments become 2.0 savvy. Recent report published by McKinsey &amp; Company got it spot on!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to the report and from our experience, in recent years we have seen a significant improvement in the use of information and communication technology by central and local governments. Majority of governments have websites and offer certain public services online such as paying tax, paying for parking tickets or renewing personal identification documents or driving licences. Moreover, public service employees use the internet on regular basis to communicate and to manage other resources.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">These improvements were made possible thanks to significant spending by the governments; however, the public sector services still lag far behind the private sector. Many funding schemes designed to transform the government failed, and the benefits are not immediately obvious. Citizens are increasingly more demanding as the use of ICT and social media by private companies is highly advanced and the private sector standards are seem far from reachable by the public sector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The report points out three main obstacles that decrease the impact of ICT modernisation funded by the public sector: ‘ineffective governance, lack of Web-related capabilities, and reluctance to allow user participation in the creation of applications and content’.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I personally agree with the last point the most. Local authorities are fearful to allow citizens co-create their website or to post blogs expressing their concerns and many believe that council’s website is an official informative source and should not be transformed into a place of discussion and Facebook/Twitter debates. I agree that we don’t want to see offensive postings when we are looking to pay our parking tickets, however, having a space where I can say what I think would help my neighbourhood would come often very handy. So where is the limit and how to overcome this problem?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">After a successful opening of the French pilot on the 16<sup>th</sup> of October with the Sofia Café event in Sofia Antipolis the UK pilot opened its site for argument visualisation pioneers on the 13<sup>th</sup> of November.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Wave project tests a state-of-the-art argument visualisation tool in three pilot sites &#8211; France, Lithuania and the UK &#8211; by inviting climate change enthusiasts and – during the test stage – local residents in selected regions of the pilot countries. Users are asked to read opinions of others and express their views on climate change issues such as the development of wind farms near London. Discussions are portrayed on the colour coded argument visualisation map allowing people to easily follow the flow of arguments. The results of the discussions will be feed back to government decision makers to ensure each opinion is heard.</p>
