		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, I think you&#039;re right. Commercial SNS like Facebook are a vital tool as they are perfect for spreading a message, recruitment and building social capital over the longer term. But they are inherently poor places for high quality engagement to occur. It&#039;s pretty  clear to me from my work that we need both public networks and proprietary platforms (not saying they can&#039;t be built on open platforms, just proprietary in terms of purpose and content).
